# Photo Stream

iCloud supports Photo Stream which represents a center place for photos across diferent devices that now includes Windows PC. Firstly turn on Photo Stream setting on the devices where you would like to upload to and download from Photo Stream.On Windows PC, open the iCloud app, select *Photos*, and clikc the *Options* on the right. There you can choose to turn on Photo Stream for your Windows PC. Similary on Iphone, in settings, *Photos & Camera* or *iCloud*, toggle *My Photo Stream*.

But I prefer to turn off *Photo Sharing* option at the same time.

# Sync Notes with Outlook on Windows

On iphone you can sync Notes with iCloud. If you would like to export the notes to your PC as normal files. You should firstly disble the synchronization with iCloud in your phone settings.

Then connect your iphone to iTunes, click *info*, you will find an option called *Sync notes with Outlook*. Tick it and click apply! Done.

Everything else is auto-completed by iTunes. Now open your Outlook application you will find it.
