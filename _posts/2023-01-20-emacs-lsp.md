# LSP #

[Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is originally from Mircosoft and now develops to a standard protocol.

LSP works in a client/server mode. In this post, the client is usually package of IDE (e.g. Emacs), while the server is specific to programing language (e.g. C/C++).

To configure Emacs with LSP support, we firstly, install the *eglot* in Emacs, then install a language-specific LSP server on your host, and might do some setup in *init.el* depending on the LSP server requirement.

# Emacs eglot #

Emacs supports LSP by its built-in package [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) or 3rd-party package [emacs-lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).

*eglot* has less features but requires less dependencies. What is more, it is official!

To install the *eglot* client, just run `M-x package-install RET eglot RET`.

# LSP Servers #

## C/C++ clangd ##

Install the C/C++ LSP server [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) on Arch Linux.

```bash
~ $ sudo pacman -S clang

~ $ clangd --version
```

Make sure the value of variable *eglot-server-programs* contains `c-mode` and `c++-mode`. All the languages major mode listed [here](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot#connecting-to-a-server) in is enabed by default.

Please open up a C/C++ source file and run `M-x eglot`. You will find LSP server *clangd* is automatically launched on your host, as the child process of Emacs. To shutdown the LSP server, just run `M-x eglot-shutdown`.

However, we'd like to automatically launch the LSP server upon a C/C++ source file is loaded. Add the following contents *init.el*.

```lisp
(require 'eglot)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
```

## LUA lua-lsp ##

This section assumes we are in Arch Linux system with mutliple Lua versions installed (e.g. *extra/lua53* and *extra/lua54*).

To install *lua-lsp*, we should install Lua package manager *luarocks* first. However, due to multiple Lua versions exist on the system, we have to [manually build](https://stackoverflow.com/q/20321560) individual *luarocks* for each Lua version.

```bash
~ $ sudo pacman -S luarocks
```

*rocks tree* refers the the root dir storing rocks contents. To avoid conflicts, we'd better configure different rocks tree for different Lua versions. Take Lua `5.3` for example, we will configure its rocks tree to *~/.luarocks53*.

Default Luarocks [Luarocks config](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Config-file-format) (just a Lua script) is located under ~/etc/luarocks*. We can inspect the *full* configuration as below.

```bash
~ $ luarocks --local --lua-version 5.3 config --scope user
config_files = {
   nearest = "/home/outsinre/.luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
   system = {
      file = "/etc/luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
      found = true
   },
   user = {
      file = "/home/outsinre/.luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
      found = true
   }
}
--
-- skipped

rocks_trees = {
   {
      name = "user",
      root = "/home/outsinre/.luarocks"
   },
   {
      name = "system",
      root = "/usr"
   }
}
```

Let's change the current user's rocks tree for Lua `5.3`.

```bash
~$ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/luarocks/
~$ cp /etc/luarocks/config-5.3.lua .config/luarocks/

~ $ vim .config/luarocks/config-5.3.lua
>{ name = "user", root = home .. "/.luarocks53" };

~ $ luarocks --local --lua-version 5.3 config --scope user
```

Finally, we install *lua-lsp* by explicitly provide the rocks tree.

```bash
# omit option '--local'
~ $ luarocks --lua-version 5.3 --tree ~/.luarocks53 --server=http://luarocks.org/dev install lua-lsp
```

Now, we add the *lua-lsp* binary to PATH.

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile

eval $(luarocks --lua-version 5.3 path)
```

Repeat above steps for other Lua versions.
