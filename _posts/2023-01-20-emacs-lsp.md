# LSP #

[Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) is originally from Mircosoft and now develops to a standard protocol.

LSP works in a client/server mode. In this post, the client is usually package of IDE (e.g. Emacs), while the server is specific to programing language (e.g. C/C++).

To configure Emacs with LSP support, we firstly, install the *eglot* in Emacs, then install a language-specific LSP server on your host, and might do some setup in *init.el* depending on the LSP server requirement.

# Emacs eglot #

Emacs supports LSP by its built-in package [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) or 3rd-party package [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode).

*eglot* has less features but requires less dependencies. What is more, it is official!

1. To install the *eglot* client, just run `M-x package-install RET eglot RET`.
2. To start *eglot* for a LSP.
   1. Manually run `M-x eglot`.
   2. Automatically by `(add-hook 'foo-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)`.
3. To turn off *eglot* and LSP.
   1. Manually run `M-x eglot-shutdown`.
   2. Automatically by `(setq eglot-autoshutdown t)`.

# LSP Servers #

## C/C++ clangd ##

Install the C/C++ LSP server [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation) on Arch Linux.

```bash
~ $ sudo pacman -S clang

~ $ clangd --version
```

Make sure the value of variable *eglot-server-programs* contains `c-mode` and `c++-mode`. All the languages major mode listed [here](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot#connecting-to-a-server) in is enabed by default.

Please open up a C/C++ source file and run `M-x eglot`. You will find LSP server *clangd* is automatically launched on your host, as the child process of Emacs. To shutdown the LSP server, just run `M-x eglot-shutdown`.

However, we'd like to automatically launch the LSP server upon a C/C++ source file is loaded. Add the following contents *init.el*.

```lisp
(require 'eglot)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
```

## lua-lsp ##

>deprecated; see [lua-language-server](#lua-language-server)

This section assumes we are in Arch Linux system with mutliple Lua versions installed (e.g. *extra/lua53* and *extra/lua54*).

To install [lua-lsp](https://github.com/Alloyed/lua-lsp), we should install Lua package manager *luarocks* first.

```bash
~ $ sudo pacman -S luarocks
```

Default Luarocks [config](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Config-file-format) (just a Lua script) is located under */etc/luarocks*. We can inspect the *full* configuration of Lua `5.3` as below.

```bash
~ $ luarocks --lua-version 5.3 config --scope user
config_files = {
   nearest = "/etc/luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
   system = {
      file = "/etc/luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
      found = true
   },
   user = {
      file = "/home/outsinre/.luarocks/config-5.3.lua",
      found = true
   }
}
--
-- skipped
--
rocks_trees = {
   {
      name = "user",
      root = "/home/outsinre/.luarocks"
   },
   {
      name = "system",
      root = "/usr"
   }
}
```

`rocks_trees` refers the the root dir storing rocks contents. To avoid conflicts, we'd better configure different rocks tree for different Lua versions. Take Lua `5.3` for example, we will configure its rocks tree to *~/.luarocks53*.

Let's change the current user's rocks tree for Lua `5.3`.

```bash
~$ mkdir -p $HOME/.config/luarocks/
~$ cp /etc/luarocks/config-5.3.lua .config/luarocks/

~ $ vim .config/luarocks/config-5.3.lua
>{ name = "user", root = home .. "/.luarocks53" };

~ $ luarocks --lua-version 5.3 config --scope user
```

Finally, we install *lua-lsp* by explicitly provide the rocks tree.

```bash
# please omit option '--local'
~ $ luarocks --lua-version 5.3 --tree ~/.luarocks53 --server=http://luarocks.org/dev install lua-lsp
```

Now, we add the *lua-lsp* binary to PATH.

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile

eval $(luarocks --lua-version 5.3 path)
```

The built-in method above is provided by Luarocks but it exports `LUA_PATH` and `LUA_CPATH` as well. We may just want to set "PATH".

```bash
~ $ nano -w ~/.bash_profile
>PATH=$HOME/.luarocks53/bin:$PATH
```

To automatically launch *lua-lsp*, add the following lines to *init.el*.

```lisp
(require 'eglot)
(add-hook 'lua-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
```

Repeat above steps for other Lua versions.

## lua-language-server ##

[lua-lsp](#lua-lua-lsp) has not been updated for years, and so we swtich the [lua-language-server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/).

Let's install "lua-language-server" [manually](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Getting-Started#command-line) per-user.

```bash
~ $ wget https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/releases/download/3.6.19/lua-language-server-3.6.19-linux-x64.tar.gz

~ $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/lua-language-server

~ $ tar -xzvf lua-language-server-3.6.19-linux-x64.tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/lua-language-server
```

We cannot add *lua-language-server* to "PATH" directly, instead we must [create a wrapper](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Getting-Started#command-line), namely *~/bin/lsp-lua*.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

exec "${HOME}/.local/share/lua-language-server/bin/lua-language-server" "--configpath=${HOME}/.local/share/lua-language-server/settings.lua" "$@"
```

Now let's have a try.

```bash
~ $ lsp-lua --version
3.6.19
```

*lua-language-server* by default is [not](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot#connecting-to-a-server) added to [eglot](#emacs-eglot). So, we should [manually set it up](https://joaotavora.github.io/eglot/#Eglot-and-LSP-Servers) in *init.el*.

```lua
(with-eval-after-load 'eglot
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
               '(lua-mode "~/bin/lsp-lua")))
(add-hook 'lua-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
```

Restart Emacs and open a Lua file, *eglot* would automatically invokes *~/bi/lsp-lua* to launch *lua-language-server*.

Before closing this section, let's [configure](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File) *lua-language-server* a bit. Remember that, *~/bin/lsp-lua* has specified the option `--configpath` to configurations from a Lua file *settings.lua* as follows. Plese read [Settings](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings) for a complete list of parameters.

```lua
return {
    Lua = {
        ["runtime.version"] = "Lua 5.1",
        completion = {
            callSnippet = "Both",
            displayContext = 1,
            keywordSnippet = "Both",
        },
        ["hint.enable"] = true,
        ["format.enable"] = true,
    }
}
```

To format current buffer, just run `M-x: eglot-format-buffer`.
