# Fedora RHEL CentOS

1. Fedora is a Linux distribution released under GPL.
2. Red Hat, Inc. copy the source code from Fedora, make modifications, release it as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distribution.

   Due to GPL, Red Hat, Inc. is obligated to disclose RHEL source code.
3. CentOS (Community ENTerprise OS) is another Linux distribution built from the source of RHEL directly, with the intention of making CentOS binary compatible with RHEL (library versions are the same; binaries work on RHEL also work on CentOS).
   1. The main purpose of CentOS is to make RHEL available to pulbic users.
   2. Remove Red Hat, Inc. logo.
4. Fedora - RHEL - CentOS.

# YUM RPM

The relation between *rpm* (Redhat Package Manager) command and *yum* (Yellow dog Updater, Modified) command is analogous to *dpkg* and *apt-get*.

Basically, *yum* is more inteliggent than *rpm*. *rpm* wants to know the exact location of target *.rpm* file while *yum* only needs the package name. *yum* also takes care of dependencies. However, *rpm* is somehow a lightweight tool with concise output.

Check 'SPECIFYING PACKAGE NAMES' in the man page of *yum* to check how to pass globs arguments. The full name of a *.rpm* package is as follows:

```
name-version-release.os.arch.rpm

vim-enhanced-7.4.160-4.el7.x86_64
# name:     vim-enhanced
# version:  7.4.160
# release:  4
# os:       el7
# arch:     x86_64
# suffix:   rpm

centos-release-7-4.1708.el7.centos.x86_64
# name:     centos-release
# version:  7
# release:  4.1708
# os:       el7.centos
# arch:     x86_64
```

1. Package *version* is also called *major version*, indicating the upstream source version from developers. Package *release* is also called *minor version*, indicating the final *.rpm* file by RHEL compliling/building/patching. Especially, RHEL may add customized patches or bug fixes to the major version, building a new *.rpm* package to the repository.
2. *os* may be el6 (rhel6), centos6, el5, suse11 etc.

## rpm

RPM manages a database of package information located under */var/lib/rpm/*.

Kering:

```bash
~ # rpm --import /path/to/key.pub
~ # rpmkeys --import http://www.example.com/key.pub
```

Once imported, all public keys in the keyring can be managed as a package. Commands applied to a package can also be applied to a key like query, erase, information etc.

```bash
~ # ls /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
~ # rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*
~ # rpm -q gpg-pubkey --queryformat "%{summary} ->%{version}-%{release}\n"
~ # rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-db42a60e
```

Install:

```bash
~ # rpm -ivvh --test /path/to/pkg.rpm     # test before insall
~ # rpm -ivh /path/to/pkg.rpm             # install
~ # rpm -Uvh /path/to/pkg.rpm             # upgrade
~ # rpm -Fvh /path/to/pkg.rpm             # refresh
```

1. The path can be an ftp/http URL.
2. `-i, --install` is the general form of installing a package, and can be used to install multiple versions of the same package, like Gentoo's *slot* concept.
3. `-U, --upgrade` is similar to `-i, --install` except that all other version(s) of the package are removed after the new package is installed.

   The package may be or may not be installed locally.
4. `-F, --freshen` requires an earlier version is already installed.

Uninstall/Erase:

```bash
~ # rpm -evv pkg                     # uninstall a pkg
```

Query:

```bash
~ # rpm -qa | grep 'regex'
~ # rpm -qi pkg; rpm -qip pkg.rpm                     # query pkg information
~ # rpm -ql pkg; rpm -qlp pkg.rpm                     # list pkg files
~ # rpm -qR pkg; rpm -qRp pkg.rpm                     # list dependencies
~ # rpm -qf /path/to/file                             # file owner
~ # rpm -qdf /path/to/file                            # file owner's man pages
```

Verify:

```bash
~ # rpm -V pkg; rpm -vp pkg.rpm                       # verify
```

Verifying a package compares information about files installed locally with information about files taken from the package metadata stored in the RPM database. Any discrepancies are displayed.

## yum

The *main* configuration of YUM is */etc/yum.conf* and specific repository configuration files are placed in */etc/yum.repos.d/*. Within the main configuration file, *cachedir* defines the location of cached *.rpm* packages (defaults to */var/cache/yum/$basearch/$releasever*).

By default, of the built-in repositories, only 'CentOS-Base.repo' is *enabled=1*:

1. `$releasever` indicates the main version. For example, the main version of CentOS 5.8 is 5.
2. `$arch` indicates the architecture like `x8_64`, `i386/i586/i686`.
3. `$basearch` is similar to `$arch`, but is *base* architecture: either `x86_64` or `i386`.

>After any edits of these configuration files, in order to clear any cached information, and make sure the changes are immediately recoginized, as root run `yum clean all`.

Information:

```bash
~ # yum history

~ # yum list [all | installed | available | updates] [pkg]
~ # yum check-update

~ # yum repolist [all | enabled | disabled]

~ # yum [search | info] pkg

~ # yum provides/whatprovides /path/to/file             # rpm -qf
~ # repoquery --whatprovides '*bin/grep'
~ # repoquery --list pkg
```

1. *list updates* is almost the same as *check-update*. As the command form implies, *check-update* is useful in Shell scripting while *list updates* is for humans. Please pay attention, their exit status code difference.
2. 'yum provides' only search which package provides the pathname. 'rpm -qf' requires that the package is installed or existence of the *.rpm* file.

   Speed up the search, use 'repoquery' from 'yum-utils' package. Especially, it list all files provided by a package even it is not installed.

Cache:

```bash
~ # yum clean [ packages | metadata | expire-cache | rpmdb | plugins | all ]
~ # yum makecache
```

Install:

```bash
~ # yum [-y] install pkg1 pkg2
~ # yum reinstall pkg1 pkg2

~ # yum update pkg1 pkg2
~ # yum update-to pkg1-ver1 pkg2-ver2

~ # yum remove pkg1 pkg2
```

Multiple RPM packages can be grouped and installed:

```bash
~ # yum group [list | info | summary |install | upgrade | remove | mark ] grp

~ # yum [-y] groupinstall grp1 grp2
~ # yum [-y] groupupdate grp1 grp2
~ # yum [-y] groupremove grp1 grp2
```

# 3rd-party [Repositories](https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories)

Of the 3rd party repositories, IUS and Remi (both depend on EPEL) is recommended over Webtatic.

## EPEL

EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) is open source and free community based repository project from [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) team which provides 100% high quality add-on software packages.

```bash
~ # yum [search | info] epel-release
~ # yum --enablerepo=extras install epel-release
~ # yum repolist enabled
```

To specify repository when installing package:

```bash
~ # yum --enablerepo=epel search/info/install nginx
```

The `--enablerepo` option overides the permanent option setting in the */etc/yum/\*.repo* files for only the current command. `--disablerepo` does the opposite for enabled repos.

## [Inline with Upstream Stable (IUS)](https://ius.io/GettingStarted/)

```bash
~ # rpm -Uvh https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
```

Read [IUS Usage](https://ius.io/Usage/) for more information.

## Webtatic (DEPRECATED)

The [Webtatic Yum repository](https://webtatic.com/projects/yum-repository/) is a CentOS/RHEL repository containing updated web-related packages like *git*.

```bash
~ # rpm -Uvh https://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el7/webtatic-release.rpm
```

## [CentOS-5.8](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/359902)

CentOS-5 reached the end of its lifecycle as of March 31, 2017. The official [baseurl](http://mirror.centos.org/centos/5/readme) is deprecated and moved to a backup location [Vault](http://vault.centos.org/5.8/). Packages there is no longer maintained or upgraded, and may suffer from security risks.

However, we sometimes have to maintain ancient releases for whatever reasons. To install packages through *yum*, [point repositories to the new location](https://www.centos.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=62130): either manually edit */etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo* or install *centos-release-5-8.el5.centos.x86_64.rpm* file.

1. For each section (i.e. Base) Comment out both the *mirrorlist=* and *baseurl=* lines.
2. Add a new baseurl line:

   ```
   baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/5.8/os/$basearch/
   ```

   1. Replace */os/* part approriately for other sections like */updates/*.
   2. It is highly recommended to replace 5.8 with 5.11, upgrading the system to CentOS 5.11

   Alternatively, install the corresponding repository package:

   ```
   root@tux ~ # wget http://vault.centos.org/5.11/os/x86_64/CentOS/centos-release-5-11.el5.centos.x86_64.rpm
   root@tux ~ # rpm -Uvh centos-release-5-11.el5.centos.x86_64.rpm
   ```

   For other repositories like EPEL, Webtatic etc., find their archive URL and repeat the same procedures.
3. Update

   ```bash
   root@tux ~ # rpm -q centos-release; cat /etc/redhat-release; cat /etc/centos-release
   root@tux ~ # yum clean all; yum makecache
   root@tux ~ # yum list updates; yum update
   root@tux ~ # reboot
   root@tux ~ # yum install epel-release; yum install git
   ```

Here is an example of manually edited Centos-Base.repo:

```
# CentOS-Base.repo
#
# The mirror system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each mirror to pick mirrors that are updated to and
# geographically close to the client.  You should use this for CentOS updates
# unless you are manually picking other mirrors.
#
# If the mirrorlist= does not work for you, as a fall back you can try the 
# remarked out baseurl= line instead.
#

# Packaging

## Extracting RPM

Upon receving a *.rpm* file, we can extract the contents with *rpm2cpio* and *cipo*:

```bash
~ $ mkdir dst; cd dst
~ $ rpm2cpio /path/to/pkg.rpm | cpio -idmv
~ $ find .
```

1. `-i`: extract;
2. `-d`: make directories;
3. `-m`: preserve modification time;
4. `-v': verbose.

# systemd

```bash
~ # systemctl show/cat unit.service
~ # systemctl status/enable/start/stop/restart/disable unit@instance.service
~ # systemctl list-unit-files/list-units/--failed/reset-failed
~ # systemctl edit unit.service (overide system unit)
~ # systemctl daemon-reload/reload
~ # systemctl enable/disable unit@sub.service
```

# log

```bash
~ # journalctl -xef
~ # journalctl -u nginx
~ # systemctl status unit.service
```

# systemctl mask

```bash
~ # systemctl stop iptables-services
~ # sysremctl disable iptables-services
~ # systemctl mask iptables-services
```

# SSH

```bash
~ # ssh-add
~ # ssh-copy-id -p 12345 root@12.23.56.78
# add an entry to ~/.ssh/config
```

# Create User Account

```bash
~ # useradd -ms /bin/bash -u 1000 username
~ # passwd username
~ # ssh-copy-id -p 12345 username@12.34.56.78
# add an entry to ~/.ssh/config
```

# Pip/Virtualenv

```bash
~ # yum install python-pip python-virtualenv
~ # pip install -U pip
```

# SS

```bash
~ # mkdir -p ~/opt/pyvenv2.6
~ # virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/opt/pyvenv2.6
~ # pip install git+https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks.git@master
# or
~ # wget https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/archive/master.zip
~ # pip install master.zip
```

## Server Json

```bash
~ # mkdir -p /etc/shadowsocks
~ # vi /etc/shadowsocks/server.json
```

Fill in the fileds without any comments:

```json
{
    "server":"::0",
    "server_port":3900,
    "local_address":"127.0.0.1",
    "local_port":1080,
    "password":"mypassword",
    "timeout":300,
    "method":"aes-256-cfb",
    "fast_open":true,
    "workers":2
}
```

## TCP Fast Open

```bash
~ # vi /etc/sysctl.d/10-tcp-fast-open.conf
# net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen = 3
~ # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/10-tcp-fast-open.conf
```

1. Unfortunately CentOS 7 does not satisfy lower kernel bound - 3.7.1.
2. It should be enabled on cleint and server simutaneously.

### A quick test

```bash
~ # ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/server.json --user nobody -d start -vv
```

## [Server Systemd service](https://yuyii.com/2015/12/28/shadowsocks-systemd/)

>Please reinstall Shadowsocks into system-wide location. The above *virtualenv* version was a test.

This is another useful reference [compiling shadowsocks-libev on CentOS 6](http://www.leyar.me/Compile-shadowsocks-libev-in-CentOS7/).

```bash
# vi /etc/systemd/system/shadowsocks.service
```

### simple Type

```
[Unit]
Description=Shadowsocks Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
PermissionsStartOnly=true
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/mkdir -p /run/shadowsocks
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chown nobody:nobody /run/shadowsocks
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/local/bin/kcptun-server -c /etc/shadowsocks/kcptun.json &" nobody

Restart=on-abort
User=nobody
Group=nobody
UMask=0027

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Please be noted that:

1. *simple* Type is used so that Shadowsocks does not *forking* itself so that daemon mode is handed over to *systemd*.
   1. Do *not* add `-d start/stop/restart` arguments to ExecStart
   2. No PIDFile and `--pid-file`  required. Read more on [doesn't make sense to set PIDFile= by simple services](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=723942#c4).
2. You may find a special line with *kcptun*. Neglect it now for it will be discussed later on.

### forking Type

```
[Unit]
Description=Shadowsocks Server

```

## [kcptun](https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun)

*kcptun* estabilishs a KCP tunnel to speed up TCP connection by encapsulating TC packets within UDP flooding. It may introduce twice or even triple traffic depending on arguments choosen. You are advised to use it only in WI-FI environment.

To add *kcptun* support, just insert a line into Systemd service file:

```
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/su -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/local/bin/kcptun-server -c /etc/shadowsocks/kcptun.json &" nobody
```

Attention to trailing `&` of `-c` argument.

# erase/remove

```bash
~ # yum erase/remove pkg-name
~ # yum autoremove
```

*erase* is an alias to *remove*.

# Notes

1. Remember to backup */etc/letsencrypt/* that contains Let's Encrypt key and certificates, especially the account sub-directly.
