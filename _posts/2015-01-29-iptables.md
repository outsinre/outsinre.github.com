> iptables is a program used to configure and manage the kernels netfilter modules. It basically serves as a firewall to filter network traffic.

# 1 ABCs

1. *iptables* and *ip6tables* are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the *tables* of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter *rules* in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each table contains a number of built-in *chains* and may also contain user-defined chains.
2. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.  This is called a *target*,  which  may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.
3. A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If  the packet  does  not  match, the next rule in the chain is examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the target, which  can  be  the  name  of  a user-defined chain, one of the targetsdescribed in iptables-extensions(8),  or  one  of  the  special  valuesACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

# Configuration

1. Launch

    ```bash
    # rc-sevice ip[6]tables start
    # rc-update add ip[6]tables default
    ```
2. Save/backup current rules.

    If you ever configured *iptables* before, then save it before any update.  By default, *iptables* itself assume its default but simple rules.

    ```bash
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save ;; will save rules to /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save
    or
    # ip[6]tables-save > /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save
    
    # cp /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save /path/to/ip[6]tables-rules-save-backup
    ```
    Upon exit (i.e. system shutdown/reboot etc), *ip[6]tables* will save rules to */var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save* automatically (possibly override previous rules).
3. Restore the old previous rules:

    ```bash
    # ip[6]tables-restore < /path/to/ip[6]tables-rules-save-backup
    
    # ip[6]tables-save > /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save
    or
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save
    ```
    This happens usually if you don't like your rules updates while the old */var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save* is overriden.

# Update rules

1. Refer to the 1st reference, it supplies a basic script (say *iptables-rules.sh*) for *Generating firewall rules for client*.

    ```bash
    # chmod u+x /path/to/iptables-rules
    # ./path/to/iptables-rules
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save
    ```
    The contents of *iptables-rules.sh* are bash commands to add rules while those of *rules-save* are real rules.

    This way of totally removing the old and adding new ones is rarely used.

    For daily administration, we can update rules by shell command on terminal ocassionally.
2. Remove a rule

    Suppose you have a bunch of rules, but only want to remove one single rule instead of setting from stratch. Use `-A -D`.

    ```
    iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p TCP --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:9053
    ```
    Above we *-A append* a rule, and how to remove it?

    ```
    iptables -t nat -D OUTPUT -p TCP --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:9053
    ```
    Just switch `-A` to `-D` - delete a rule.

# Check

1. At any time, you can check current rules that *ip[6]tables* is using:

    ```
    # ip[6]tables [-t filter | nat | mangle | raw | security] -S
    # ip[6]tables [-t filter | nat | mangle | raw | security] -L -nv
    ```
    If `-t` argument is not supplied, then only *filter* is printed.
