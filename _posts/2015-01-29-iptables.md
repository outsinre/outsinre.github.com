> iptables is a program used to configure and manage the kernels netfilter modules. It basically serves as a firewall to filter network traffic.

# 1 ABCs

1. *iptables* and *ip6tables* are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the *tables* of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter *rules* in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables may be defined.  Each table contains a number of built-in *chains* and may also contain user-defined chains.
2. Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.  This is called a *target*,  which  may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.
3. A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If  the packet  does  not  match, the next rule in the chain is examined; if it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the target, which  can  be  the  name  of  a user-defined chain, one of the targetsdescribed in iptables-extensions(8),  or  one  of  the  special  valuesACCEPT, DROP or RETURN.

# Configuration

1. Add to *default* runlevel.

    ```bash
    # rc-update add ip[6]tables default
    ```
2. Save current rules.

    If you ever configured *iptables*, then save it before any modification.  What's more, by default, *iptables* itself assume some default rules.

    ```bash
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save
    # cp /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save /path/to/ip[6]tables-rules-backup
    ```
    Each time of execution, the rules are saved to */var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save*, thus overriding previous ones. Once you would like to restore the previous rules:

    ```bash
    # ip[6]tables-restore < ip[6]tables-rules-backup
    # ip[6]tables-save > /var/lib/ip[6]tables/rules-save
    or
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save
    ```
3. Add my own rules.

    Refer to the 1st reference, it supplies a basic script (say *iptables-rules.sh*) for *Generating firewall rules for client*.

    ```bash
    # chmod u+x /path/to/iptables-rules
    # /path/to/iptables-rules
    # ip[6]tables -S
    # ip[6]tables -L -nv
    # rc-service ip[6]tables save
    ```
    The contents of *iptables-rules.sh* are bash commands to add rules while those of *rules-save* are real rules.
