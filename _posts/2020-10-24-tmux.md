# Overview #

[Tmux](https://gist.github.com/andreyvit/2921703) has sessions, windows (term tabs), and panes (rectangle area on screen). Each session a few windows, each window a few panes. We can regard Tmux Window and Pane as Emacs Frame and Window. User can see only one window at a time. Usually, a window is splitted into multiple panes, allowing jumping back and forth.

# Configuration #

```
# /etc/tmux.conf
# ~/.tmux.conf

# copy mode
#setw -g mode-keys emacs
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Mouse support - set to on if you want to use the mouse
* setw -g mode-mouse off
* set -g mouse-select-pane off
* set -g mouse-resize-pane off
* set -g mouse-select-window off

# Set the default terminal mode to 256color mode
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# enable activity alerts
setw -g monitor-activity on
set -g visual-activity on
setw -g monitor-silence 30
set -g visual-silence on

# Center the window list
set -g status-justify centre
```

# Try Tmux #

Start new session:

```bash
~ $ tmux new-session -s session-name
```

To put Tmux background, we *detach* by `Ctrl-b d` shortcut.

List and kill session:

```bash
~$ tmux ls
~$ tmux kill-session -t session-name
```

Attatch to session:

```bash
~ $ tmux a | at | attatch
~ $ tmux a -t session-name
```

# Tmux Sub-commands #

Tmux has many sub-commands, like *new-session*, *kill-session* and *attach-session* above. Use `tmux list-commands` to show all supported sub-commands.

Many sub-commands has built-in aliases, like *new* for *new-session*. We can also just type a few leading characters of a sub-command as long as no ambiguity incurred. For example, *attach-session* can be expressed as just a single character *a* or a simple word *att*.

Once attached to a session, we can use key bindings to trigger sub-commands within the session. We call those key bindings *command key bindings*. Command key bindings share the same prefix key `Ctrl-b`. For example, to create a window for the session, use `Ctrl-b c`.

We can also manually input sub-commands within a session. Use `Ctrl-b :` to get into *command mode*, and then input the sub-command. For instance, `Ctrl-b : source-file ~/.tmux.conf` reloads Tmux configuration on the fly. If you mis-typed a sub-commands, then `Ctrl-u` and try again. To get out of command mode, just press `ESC`.

# Tmux Command Key Bindings #

Apart from command mode, Tmux has the *copy mode* by `Ctrol-b [`. Copy mode is used to navigate within shell screen in casef we don't have X (i.e. scroll up). Copy mode has its own key bingdings. By default, Tmux uses Emacs-like key bindings and gets out `ESC`. You can change to Vi style and get out by `ENTER`.

Check supported key bindings of copy mode by `tmux list-keys -T copy-mode` (without `-T`, list all Tmux key bindings). You will find that only part of Emacs or Vi key bindings are supported.

The following are some general Tmux key bingdings and the corresponding sub-commands.

Session operation:

```
: command mode
[ copy mode

s  list sessions
$  rename a session
```

Window operation:

```
c  create window
w  list windows
n  next window
p  previous window
f  find window
&  kill window
```

Pane operation:

```
%  vertical split
"  horizontal split

o  swap panes
x  kill pane
+  break pane into window (e.g. to select text by mouse to copy)
-  restore pane from window
‚çΩ  space - toggle between layouts
q (pane numbers will show up on screen. When the numbers show up, press the relevant key, switching to that pane)
{ (Move the current pane left)
} (Move the current pane right)
z toggle pane zoom
```

Misc operation:

```
d  detach
t  big clock
?  list shortcuts
```
