# Introductory #

macOS (Mac OS X or OS X) is a proprietary OS derived from Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), and therefore is a Unix-like system. The main difference between macOS and other Unix-like distributions is that macOS is designed with *desktop* for personal PC.

# Docker Desktop #

1. [Mac with Apple silicon](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
2. For compatibility, run *softwareupdate --install-rosetta*.

# UTM #

UTM is an open source VMM supporting iOS and OSX. What is more, it supports Apple ARM64!

1. [Installation](https://mac.getutm.app/).
2. [Gallery](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/).
3. After installation, remove and re-add the USB (DVD) drive, otherwise the boot menu break from time to time.
4. Follow tutorial [UTM Ubuntu 20.04](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04).

UTM uses *davfs2* to share files with host OS. Here is setup on guest OS:

```bash
# clipboard sharing, mouse integration
~ $ apt install spice-vdagent

# file shareing
~ $ apt install spice-webdavd davfs2

# group
~ $ sudo usermod -a -G davfs2 kong
~ $ sudo reboot

# /etc/fstab
http://127.0.0.1:9843   /media/webdav   davfs   _netdev,noauto,noexec,user,uid=kong,gid=kong    0       0

~ $ mkdir -p /media/webdav
~ $ mount /media/webdav
~ $ ls -al ~/.davfs2/

# auto password
# ~/.davfs2/secrets
/media/webdav   kong    kong

~ $ umount /media/wevdav
~ $ mount /media/wevdav
```

If just use Web browser (e.g. VM has X), then no need to install *davfs2*.

# Homebrew #

After installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), we can optionally update [mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/help/homebrew/).

Everything of Homebrew is located at `$(brew --prefix)` (e.g., */opt/homebrew*). To debug Brew, try *brew doctor*.

*brew* supports installing both CLI cms and GUI *formulae* (i.e. package).

1. CLI

   ```bash
   ~ $ brew install <formulae>
   ```

2. GUI

   ```bash
   ~ $ brew install [--cask] <formulae>
   ```

   *brew cask* is no longer a supported command.

## Homebrew Tap ##

A *tap* is a repository from where brew retrieves packages. By default, brew assumes a Github repository.

Official tap list.

```bash
~ $ brew tap
homebrew/cask
homebrew/core
```

Say we have a tap named as *user/repo*, the repository is `https://github.com/<user>/homebrew-<repo>` (*homebrew* prefix). Take *homebrew/core* for example, the Github URL is <https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core>. The tap is cloned to local disk under *$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps*.

We can add/remove 3rd-party taps on demand.

```bash
# assume Github repo
~ $ brew tap <user/repo>
# -or-
~ $ brew tap <user/homebrew-repo>

# Other repo with specific URL
~ $ brew tap <user/repo> <URL>

~ $ brew untap user/repo
```

Once added, we can install formulae as in [Homebrew](#homebrew).

However, brew tries to install a formulae from official taps first. In case of duplicate formulae names among taps, We can install a formulae from a specific 3rd-party tap.

```bash
~ $ brew install user/repo/formulae
```

### Custom Tap ###

This section shows how to create a 3rd-party tap.

Step 1. Create an empty Github repo as the custom tap, namely [homebrew-wrk2](https://github.com/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2).

The repo name must follow pattern `homebrew-<foo>` (*homebrew* prefix). We will put our formulaes into directory "Formula".

Now, let's add the tap to Homebrew.

```bash
~ $ brew tap outsinre/wrk2

~ $ brew tap
homebrew/cask
homebrew/core
outsinre/wrk2

~ $ cd $brew --repository outsinre/wrk2)
~ $ git status

~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ tree
.
├── Formula
└── README.md

1 directory, 1 files

~ $ brew tap --eval-all outsinre/wrk2
```

Step 2. Prepare code release.

```bash
~ $ git clone git@github.com:outsinre/wrk2.git

~ $ git branch -a
~ $ git checkout wrk2-a64-support
~ $ git diff head~1

~ $ git checkout master
~ $ git merge wrk2-a64-support
~ $ git branch -d wrk2-a64-support

~ $ git tag -l
~ $ git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "release 1.0.0" HEAD
~ $ git tag -l
~ $ git show -s 1.0.0

~ $ git push origin head
~ $ git push origin 1.0.0
```

Go to Github and create release [1.0.0](https://github.com/outsinre/wrk2/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.tar.gz).

Step 3. Create formulae.

```bash
~ $ brew create --tap outsinre/wrk2 https://github.com/outsinre/wrk2/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.tar.gz
```

Command above puts the newly formulae into our local custom tap *outsinre/wrk2*. If we don't offer the `--tap` option, the formulae would, by default, be placed into the official tap (i.e. *homebrew/core*). 

An editor is popped up to edit the new formulae. Please follow [wrk.rb](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/wrk.rb) and [wrk2.rb](https://github.com/jabley/homebrew-wrk2).

Step 4. Audit the new formulae's adherence to Homebrew house style.

```bash
~ $ brew audit --strict --online outsinre/wrk2/wrk2

# more strict
~ $ brew audit --new outsinre/wrk2/wrk2

outsinre/wrk2/wrk2:
  * 2: col 9: Description shouldn't start with an article.
  * 7: col 3: `license` (line 7) should be put before `head` (line 6)
  * 24: col 12: Ambiguous splat operator. Parenthesize the method arguments if it's surely a splat operator, or add a whitespace to the right of the `*` if it should be a multiplication.
Error: 3 problems in 1 formula detected
```

Update formulae according to audit results.

Step 5. Sync local tap with Github.

```bash
~ $ cd $brew --repository outsinre/wrk2)

~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ git status
~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ git add .
~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ git commit -m "add formulae wrk2"
~ $ /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/outsinre/homebrew-wrk2$ git push origin head
```

Step 6. Install the new formulae.

```bash
~ $ brew install outsinre/wrk2/wrk2
```

If a new release is out. We should repeat steps 2 ~ 6 above. However, we can also install the from the latest source code.

```bash
~ $ brew install --HEAD outsinre/wrk2/wrk2
```
