"tar" stands for tape archive. It is an archiving file format.

1. _#_ tar czvf mydirectory.tgz mydirectory
    1. c: create and tar file
    2. z: then gzip compress the file
    3. v: verbose mode
    4. f: specify the file name _mydirectory.tgz_
    5. `.tgz` is actually the same as `.tar.gz`
2. _#_ tar xzvf mydirectory.tgz
    1. Extract the file
3. _#_ tar tzvf mydirectory.tgz -C /path/to/extract/
    1. List the contents
    2. If ommit -C, then default to current directory.
4. If change option `z` to `j`, then the compression method is `bz2` which has higher compression ratio but longer compression time.
5. For 2nd and 3rd steps, `z` or `j` can be ommitted.
