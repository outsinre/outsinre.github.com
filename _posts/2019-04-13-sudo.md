# sudo Front End #

*sudo* allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser (by default) or another user (if provided), as specified by a *security policy*.

*sudo* is just a front end and depends on a *plugin architecture* to load different security policies. We can enable plugins in */etc/sudo.conf* as below. The default plugin is *sudoers*.

```bash
[root@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]# grep ^Plugin /etc/sudo.conf
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so
```

Once a plugin is enabled, we can configure its security policies. For example, security polices of plugin *sudoers* is located in file */etc/sudoers* or */etc/sudoers.d*.

Third party developers can distribute their own plugins and security policies to work seamlessly with the *sudo* front end. This post only talks about plugin *sudoers*.

# Installation #

```bash
[root@host ~]# pacman -S sudo
```

List sudoers policy of a user.

```bash
[root@host ~]# sudo -ll -U <user>
```

# Policy Syntax #

Check the [SUDOERS FILE FORMAT](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/18880) section in the man page of *suoers(5)*.

sudoers policy is prescribed with Extented Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Do **not** despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple and take the chance to study it. 

An EBNF definition looks like the following.

```
symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2
```

Special characters `?` (optional, 0 or 1), `*` (zero or more), and `+` (one or more) mean the same thing as regex. Single quotes denote verbatim character string as opposed to a defined symbol (variable) name. The rest part of EBNF of *sudoer* is left to yourself.

The *sudoers* file is composed of two types of entries: *alias* and *user specification*. The advantage of alias is to group multiple items together and assign a meaningful label. There exist four kinds of aliases, namely 'User_Alias', 'Runas_Alias', 'Host_Alias' and 'Cmd_Alias'. When there exist only few accounts and hostnames concerned, alias is optional.

When a user is matched by multiple entries, they are applied in order but only the last match takes effect. Let's forget about EBNF and alias part (not the focus of this post). The following is a sample of user specification. It is divided into two groups by the `=` separator. The left side defines the object while the right side defines the actions.

```
USER HOSTNAME = (RUNAS_USER) COMMANDS
```

1. USER is the primary key, for which this entry is designated.

   It can be a user name (e.g. *jim*, user ID (`#1000`), group name (`%wheel`), group ID (`%#10`) etc.
2. HOSTNAME defines the location where this user specification takes effect. The *sudoers* file can be shared among multiple systems.

   This field can be hostname, IP address, network range etc. Attention please; the loopback interface, namely *locahost* or *127.0.0.1* will be ignored by *sudoers*.
3. '(RUNAS_USER) COMMANDS' refers to the combination of target user and target commands. They comprise an integrated component.
   1. '(RUNAS_USER)' is an optional field. By default, it is assumed to be '(root)'.
   2. COMMANDS specifies what commands can be executed.

Multiple components are separated by comma. Special value 'ALL' matches everything (e.g. any hostnames).

Entry below means on *debain* host, account *jim* can run */bin/ls* as acount *operator*; he can also run */bin/kill* and */usr/bin/apg* as *root*.

```
jim debian = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/apg
```
There are also other interesting fields like 'NOPASSWD:', which is left to yourself.

# Configure Policy #

1. To modify sudoers policy, please use *visudo*.
2. Personally, I'd like to put per-user policy file under directory */etc/sudoers.d/*. Usually, we name the file after the user account in question.

   To make the directory loaded, add the `#includedir` directive in */etc/sudoers*. As per the man page, *sudo* will read each policy file in */etc/sudoers.d*, [skipping](https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=5017) filenames that contain a dot '.' ro end with tilde '~'.

Below is an example.

```bash
[root@host ~]# visudo -f /etc/sudoers
[root@host ~]# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/user
#
gray	localhost	=	(jim) ALL
%wheel	ALL		=	(root) /bin/iptables
```

Once finished editting, use the option `-c` to verify syntax.

```bash
[root@host ~]# visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers
[root@host ~]# visudo -c -f /etc/sudoers.d/user
```

Then check the result:

```bash
[root@host ~]# sudo -ll -U <user>
```

# Run Command #

```bash
# run as root
[user@host ~]$ sudo <command>

# run as specific user
[userhost ~]$ sudo -u <target-user> <command>
```

If the command to ran is to edit a protected file, [sudoedit](https://superuser.com/q/785187) is preferred than `sudo vim`.

## Preserve Env ##

Sometimes it is useful to bring current Envs to target user (e.g. *root*) and commands, so that we don't bother to set again. There are multiple methods to achieve this.

Set an Env in current user.

```bash
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]$ export MY_VAR=123

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]$ echo $MY_VAR
123

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]$ printenv | grep MY_VAR
MY_VAR=123
```

Three methods as below.

1. Global security policies */etc/sudoers*. By default, *sudoers* enables option `env_reset` to reset Envs so that commands are ran in a new, minimal environment, including TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER, USERNAME, etc.

   We can add to the default list new Envs by option `env_keep` and/or `env_check` like below. Envs in `env_keep` will be preserved while `env_check` will remove Envs that is *unsafe*. Unsafe Envs refer to those Envs that contain character `/` or `%`.
   
   ```
   Defaults    env_reset
   Defaults    env_keep =  "COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS"
   Defaults    env_keep += "MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE"
   Defaults    env_keep += "LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES"
   Defaults    env_keep += "LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE"
   Defaults    env_keep += "LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY"
   
   Defaults    env_keep += "MY_VAR1 MY_VAR2"

   Defaults    env_check = "MY_VAR1 MY_VAR2"
   ```

   Alternatively, we can env prefix `env_reset` with `!` to disable the default behaviour, so that all Envs are preserved.
   
   ```
   Defaults !env_reset
   ```

   However, this method is globally available and applies to all scenarios.
   
   Refer to 'Command environment' section of *sudoers* man page.
2. Provide option [`-E, --preserve-env[=list]`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8633575/2336707) to *sudo*. We can restrict Envs by opt-arg `=list`.

   This method is convenient but limited in that it does not preserve default Envs as mentioned above.
3. Set again to command.

   ```bash
   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]$ sudo MY_VAR=$MY_VAR printenv | grep MY_VAR
   MY_VAR=123
   ```

   This method is stupid but powerful. It can even preserve default Envs.

   ```bash
   [ec2-user@ip-172-31-34-111 ~]$ sudo USER=123 HOME=test printenv | grep -E '^(USER|HOME)='
   USER=123
   HOME=test
   ```

Before closing this section, please be reminded that bring current Envs to target user/command is [dangerous](https://superuser.com/q/232231/221946).
