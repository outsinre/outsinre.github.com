# SSH ABCs

Secure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic (encrypted) network *protocol* to allow remote *login* and *other network services* to operate securely over an unsecured network.

In the old ages, *telnet* protocol traffic is plain text subject to interception. Now services on SSH can be encrypted by different ciphers (i.e. RSA, DSA etc.). In addition to *remote login*, other services can reside on SSH protocol like content transfer.

*protocol* (i.e. SSH) is different from *application* or *command* (i.e. ssh, scp etc.). On Linux system, the application that implements SSH protocol is called OpenSSH. OpenSSH gives commands like ssh, scp, sftp, ssh-keygen etc.

# Goal

In this post, I will setup remote login with Public-key infrastructure to achieve passwordless connection.

1. local host
2. remote host
3. ssh from local host to remote host without remote user password nor local public-key pair passphrase.

# Generate Public-key pair

The core of Public-key infrastructure is creating personal public and private key pair. The public key literally is distributed *publicly* over the Internet, while the private key is *privately* kept by yourself.

On local host that we connect from, run `ssh-keygen`:

```
~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "rsa-keys"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:abcdedajfajqiefafanfaqrnafafaf8rqhfafdafjajfafeaqn rsa-keys
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|        .+o+o.+==|
|       oE.o..q..=|
|      . o=o......|
|     + o.=o..s. .|
|    . + S . .... |
|     . + . ..q.  |
|    . . +    .   |
|   o ..+     w   |
|  .o==+ +        |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

1. ***Don't use ssh-dss (DSA) public key algorithm***!!! Refer to [openssh legacy](http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html). The default algorithm is *rsa* such that `-t rsa` may be omitted..
1. *~/.ssh/id_rsa* is the private key (also termed as *identity* in SSH); *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub* is the public key to be shared over the Internet.
2. It prompts for *passphrase* to encrypt public-key files *locally*. If someone steal the private key file, he cannot impersonate you to communicate on the Internet. You are encouraged to set a passphrase.

    You can just press ENTER key to not use passphrase - empty passphrase to achieve *passwordless*. This does make a difference when connecting to remote host. Details refer below.

# Distribute the public key

Now share the public key file *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub* over the Internet to remote host. *append* the key file to *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* on remote host.

*authorized_keys* is a file that stores SSH public keys. Each time a new publick-key pair is generated, append the new public key to it. To accomplish this, run `ssh-copy-id`:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10
```

Alternatively, we can use:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat - >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

1. *192.168.0.10* can also be the domain name of remote host.
2. Both ways achieve the same purpose: append the public key to *authorized_keys* file. `ssh-copy-id` automatically creates *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* if it does not exist.
3. Pay attention to `-p` argument of `mkdir`: make parent directories as needed, no error if existing.

No matter which command you chose, you should see something like:

```
The authenticity of host '[192.168.0.10]:22 ([192.168.0.10]:22)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:afjaijfjfajeiqrityqpqvnbvlaeafjadfj.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
uname@192.168.0.10's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '22' 'uname@192.168.0.10'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

1. SSH with Public-key has not been configured yet. So you are required to provide the remote host *uname* password.
2. SSH into remote host to make sure *authorized_keys* permission is *600*.

    *ssh-copy-id* can handle permissions automatically while the alternative method might not.
3. It is *distribute/copy*, NOT *cut from local host*. That means the public key should be kept locally.

# SSH

Now you can connect to remote host by Public-key.

```
ssh -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10
Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa': 
Last login: Thu Dec  3 07:59:14 2015 from 122.205.7.55
```

By default ssh server config, both public-key and uname password are enabled to accept remote login. What's more, public-key way is superior to uname password.

From the output, `ssh` prompts you to input *passphrase* of public-key files. Recall that we have set a passphrase when generating public-key pair to encrypt public-key files on local host.

*if you leave the passphrase empty* at that setup, `ssh` will login immediately without any interaction - *passwordless* login. However, such login lose security of public-key files themselves.

# Passwordless

A better way on local host is to:

1. Use passphrase to encrypt public-key files.
2. Use *ssh agent* to unlock public-key files automatically.

The little program *ssh-agent* does you a favor by managing your keys for you. You enter the passphrase once, and after that, *ssh-agent* keeps your key cached in its memory and pulls it up whenever it is asked for it *during current X/shell session*.

To use the agent first create one. Just enter `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` and thats all. This will put you in a bash shell with two important environment variables `SSH_AGENT_PID` (agent process ID) and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (agent socket location on system) exported.

Add `eval` as `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` or ``eval `ssh-agent -s` ``. **DO NOT USE `ssh-agent -s` directly which DOES NOT EXPORT the two variables for you**. This rule also applies to `ssh-agent -k` etc. commands.

After that you should add your key (file) by *ssh-add*. Without arguments, it adds the standard *identity* *~/.ssh/id_rsa*, *~/.ssh/id_dsa*, *~/.ssh/id_ecdsa*, *~/.ssh/id_ed25519* and *~/.ssh/identity* (SSHv1). To add an identity deviant from standard location or name, run `ssh-add /location/of/key`. *ssh-add* will ask for *passphrase*. After that the key is loaded into the key manager *ssh-agent* for the whole X/shell session.

1. Check if any agents exist on system: `ps -ef | grep -i ssh-agent`.

    *ssh-agent* is usually started at the beginning of the X session, or from a shell startup script like "~/.bash_profile". It works by creating a unix-socket, and registering the appropriate environment variables so that all subsequent applications can take advantage of its services by connecting to that socket. Clearly, it only makes sense to start it in the parent process of an X session to use the set of decrypted private keys in all subsequent X applications.

    On my Gentoo system, "startx" will help launch *ssh-agent* automatically.
2. `printenv | grep -i ssh`, check whether `SSH_AGENT_PID` (agent process ID) and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (agent socket location on system) are exported to current X/shell environment. All subsequent applications depend on these two variables to make use of *ssh agent* on system.
3. Current agent

    **Agents found on system does NOT guarantee those two variables exported**. For example, a sever shared among multiple users has many agents running which might be created by some of the users. Now you login for an X/shell session. That very session (applications thereof) does NOT know anything about existing agents on system since `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` are not set to one of the agents.

    The current agent means the agent to which `SSH_AGENT_PID` and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` are pointed. To switch to another agent, set the two variables to the new agent's process ID and socket path.
4. Example of adding key to agent.

    ```
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Enter passphrase for /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa: 
    Identity added: /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa)
    ```
    Type your passhrase. Now, you should NOT be prompted for a password whenever you use ssh, scp, or sftp etc. commands.
5. Limit: *ssh-add* does NOT persist across reboot/shutdown/logout due to loss of *ssh agents* or *the two variables*. So usuallly the *passwordless* login only lasts for the *current agent*.

    Each time of login and SSH connection, run *ssh-add* once to achieve passwordless login. For a server, this is fine. But on personal laptop/PC that require shutdown frequently, it is tedious/annoying to run `ssh-add`.

    This is a trade-off between security and utility. If you want *passwordless* forever, resort to *keychain*.
6. Reuse existing agents.

    For example, on my Gentoo, *ssh-agent* started with `startx` XFCE4 DE is attached to that specific X session (Xfce4-terminal emulator included). If I don't launch `startx` or switch to another virtual terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2) and login, this login shell does not either start *ssh-agent* or know the agent already launched!

    We can launch *ssh-agent* in shell's configuration script (*.bashrc*, *.bash_profile*, *.xinitrc* etc.). Add ``eval `ssh-agent -s` > /dev/null`` and `ssh-add` to *.xinitrc* (mainly for X), *bash_profile* (mainly for login shell and subsequent interactive shell), and *.bashrc* (mainly for interactive shell).

    At the end of *.bash_profile*, *.bashrc* is sourced. If you want to execute a shell script *only once* for the whole login, add to *.bash_profile* instead of *.bashrc* (would be executed each time a new terminal emulator launched).

    However, adding *ssh-agent* and *ssh-add* to shell's configuration script will always launch an new agent on every login. We only need SSH on demand! So the basic idea is to:

    1. let new X/shell reuse eixsting agents.
    2. If there is not any agents, create one.

# ssh-find-agent

ssh-find-agent is a tool:
 
1. locating existing ssh compatible agent sockets (e.g., ssh-agent, gpg-agent, gnome-keyring, osx-keychain).
2. prompt to create one if no agents found.
3. optionally (invoked with `-a` or `-c`), sets `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variables accordingly.
    1. and set temporal ssh alias

For lastest update, check GitHub.

# SSH config

1. `man ssh_config`. The client side config file */etc/ssh/ssh_config* or *~/.ssh/config*. Local host - the host that connect from.

    *ssh* command supports a variety of different parameters. For example, in order to restrict malicious attempt, you are recommended to change default port number. Other parameters are remote host IP etc. difficult and tedious to remember and input.

    There's a much more elegant and flexible solution - put those arguments in *~/.ssh/config*. The configuration files contain sections separated by “Host” specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of the patterns given in the specification.

    Each host section defines a *host alias*. When connecting, just `ssh host-alias`. *ssh* will look up alias from config file and choose the first matched to connect to.

     The first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end. Values at the beginning are superior to those afterwards. The order of privilege:

    ```
    1. command-line options
    2. user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
    3. system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
    ```
    Here is an example:

    ```
    # ~/.ssh/config
    Host vps
         HostName 192.168.0.10
         Port 1025
         User bob
         IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vps_rsa_key
    Host github-project1
        User git
        HostName github.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.project1.key
    Host github-org
        User git
        HostName github.com
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.org.key
    Host github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
    Host tunnel
        HostName database.example.com
        User coolio
        LocalForward 9906 127.0.0.1:3306
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/coolio.example.key
    ```
    From the example, different keys are set for different *github.com* projects.

    The *LocalForward* is interesting! 9906 is local port and 3306 are remote port. The application first connects to 127.0.0.1:9906 at local host and then is forwarded to 127.0.0.1:3306 at remote host by SSH tunnel. This is a special tunnel! For example, remote host port 3306 does not accept remote connections except local ones. *ssh -C -f -N -T tunnel* will do the work!

    If we replace *127.0.0.1:3306* to *youtube.com:80*, you this tunnel server as a proxy through firewall. Of course, also add 

    Most of the time, add `-C -f -N -T` arguments when ssh is soly used for port forwarding. `-C` requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections). Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files.  `-f` requests ssh to go to background just before command execution. `-N` does not execute a remote command.  `-T` disable pseudo-terminal allocation. Those are useful for just forwarding ports.

    In addition to *LocalForward*, there is also *RemoteRorward*. No matter of *local* or *remote* forward, VPS should have a public IP while the *LocalForward* or *RemoteForward* host (NOT the vps - *uname@remote-host*) usually don't have public IP or are blocked from each other.

    For instance, two host A and C are separated by their NAT networks. Host B are on the Internet with public IP which is accessible by A and B but not the reverse! How to achieve A and C's communication by SSH? Use *remoteforward*! A establishes remote forward to B. After that C connection to B will be forwarded to A.
2. *scp* can also make use of the config file.

    ```bash
    ~ $ scp bandwagon:~/Document/file.txt .
    ~ $ scp ~/Document/video.mp4 bandwagon:/Downloads
    ```
3. `man sshd_config`. The server side config file */etc/ssh/sshd_config*. Remote host - the host that connect to.

    You can disable account password login by *PasswordAuthentication no*. Then remote host can only be accessed by public-key pair. Be careful, if you lost the key pair, you probably could no longer login.

    You can also put *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* somewhere, and set *AuthorsizedKeysFile /path/to/authorized_keys*.
