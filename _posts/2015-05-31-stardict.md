A Linux dictionary which I think is the best. Easy configuration, and support customized dictionary.

1. Refer to [stardict-3][1] and [www.huzheng.org/stardict][2], and get an overview of the package.
2. Installation

   ```bash
   # emerge -av app-text/stardict
   ```

   When finished installtion, it might remind:

   ```
   * Note: festival text to speech (TTS) plugin is not built. To use festival
   * TTS plugin, please, emerge festival and enable "Use TTS program." at:
   * "Preferences -> Dictionary -> Sound" and fill in "Commandline" with:
   * "echo %s | festival --tts"
   * 
   * You will now need to install stardict dictionary files. If
   * you have not, execute the below to get a list of dictionaries:
   * 
   *   emerge -s stardict-
   ```

   Overlook this information. Since we will install real people sound. Don't need the TTL simulation one.

   *stardict* depends on *gnome-doc-utils* package and might fail with error:

   > xsltApplyStylesheet: saving to C/db-xref.xsldoc may not be possible

   This error might be solved by:

   1. MAKEOPTS="-j1" emerge -avt app-text/stardict;
   2. Run *python-updater* before emerge.

   By default, the installer does not include any dictionaries for copyright issue. So we need to install dictionaries and real people sound.
3. [Dicts][5]
4. For each dictionary:

   ```bash
   $ for filename in /path/to/stardic*.zip; do unzip $filename -d /media/Misc/Dicts/; done
   $ for filename in /path/to/stardic*.bz2; do tar vxjpf $filename -C /media/Misc/Dicts/; done
   # ln -sv /media/Misc/Dicts /usr/share/stardict/dic/myDicts
   ```
   
   The dictionaries and real sound destination could also be *~/.local/share*. More flexibly, extract the dcits and sound to Windows partition and create symlinks.
5. Real people sound:

   >You are recommended to use [142000个单词语音库][4].   

   Stardict only uses WAV sound. For MP3, we should convert to MP3 first.

   If *pronounce* USE is enabled, *WyabdcRealPeopleTTS* will be installed automatically. The *OtdRealPeopleTTS* (MP3) sound must be converted to WAV by script included, which finally occupies around 3GiB space.

   ```bash
   # tar xjvf WyabdcRealPeopleTTS.tar.bz2 -C /media/Misc/
   ```

   If use 142000 sound, configure StartDict to find it. Specially, Stardict find WAV files in 2nd directory layer.
6. <s>Set the fonts to *tahoma* otherwise the sound symbols would not display correctly or naturally</s>.
7. Set *scan*:

    ![Scan](/assets/stardict-settings.png "stardict scan")
8. *sdcv* is the *console* version of *stardict*, sharing the same set of dictionaries in */usr/share/stardict/dic*. It's really useful when you cannot find an X environment!

    You can even add *sdcv* to Emacs.
