```
flume [c] an inclined channel for conveying water (as for power); a ravine or gorge with a stream running through it.
```

Apache Flume is a *distributed* system for *collecting*, *aggregating* and moving log data from many different sources to a *centralized* data store.

1. Require Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - 1.8 or later.
2. A Flume *event* is byte payload with optional string atrributes - also called Flume *data*.
3. A Flume *agent* is a JVM process consisting of three components: *sources*, *channels*, and *sinks*.

4. When a source receives an event, it stores it into one or more channels. The channel keeps the event until it is consumed by a Flume sink.
   1. Channels are *passive* buffers between sources and sinks.
   2. Multiple agents can be connected to form a multi-hop events flow. For example, an *avro*-typed source can recive external events from an *avro*-typed sink.

# Configuration

Usually, Flume configuration files end with *.properties* suffix.

>Always keep in mind that, an agent may have multiple sources, multiple channels, and multiple sinks. How these multiple objects are configured to cooperate are important!

1. Each source, channel and sink has a *type* property.

   For example, a source type may be *exec*; a channel type may be *memory*; a sink type may be *avro*.

   Object properties are set accordingly.
2. A Flume source can have an *interceptors* property. Interceptors are used to tranform recevied events before putting them onto a channel.

   For example, an interceptor may be chosen to translate raw event data into Json format.

   ```
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.type = exec
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.channels=c12
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.command=tail -F /var/log/server.log
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.logStdErr = true
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.batchSize = 100
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.interceptors=log2Json
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.interceptors.log2Json.type=Flume.log2Json$Builder
   ```

   `Flume.log2Json$Builder` is an external Java class.
3. Multiple sinks can be grouped (*sink group*) to achieve *load_balance* or *failover* from one sink to another, with the help of *sink processor*.

   ```
   apple_agent.sinkgroups=g12a
   apple_agent.sinkgroups.g12a.sinks = k12a k12b k12c k12d k12e k12f k12g k12h
   apple_agent.sinkgroups.g12a.processor.type = load_balance
   apple_agent.sinkgroups.g12a.processor.backoff = true
   apple_agent.sinkgroups.g12a.processor.selector = round_robin
   apple_agent.sinkgroups.g12a.processor.selector.maxTimeOut = 3000
   ```

   If *backoff* is enabled, the sink processor will backlist sinks that fail, removing them for a given timeout. When the timeout ends, if the sink is still unresponsive, the timeout is increased exponentionally.
4. Each source and sink should be assigned to a channel.

   ```
   apple_agent.sources.r12a.channels = c12
   apple_agent.sources.r12b.channels = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12a.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12b.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12c.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12d.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12e.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12f.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12g.channel = c12
   apple_agent.sinks.k12h.channel = c12
   ```

# Starting an Agent

Flume distribution brings in a shell script under its bin directory: *flume-ng*. We should specify the agent name defined in configuration file.

```bash
~ # bin/flume-ng --help
~ # bin/flume-ng agent -c conf -f conf/flume-conf.properties -n $agent_name 
```
