title: Golden Image
---

*golden image* or *master* image, in the software industry, refers to a *base* Docker image built from scratch. Once build, no further changes are allowed.

Based on the golden image, we generate distributable images that are ready to be repeatedly deployed in production environment.

Distributable images may include programming language runtime, development tools, system administration tools, etc.

Customers may further customize golden images or distributable images in accord with their platforms.

The statements above apply to RPM packages as well.
