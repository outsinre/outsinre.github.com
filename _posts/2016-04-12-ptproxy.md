title: TCP Obfuscation - ptproxy
---

<s>ptproxy</s> is almost dead. The repository is ancient whilist *aisocks* has dropped support for Python 3.4! Try [simple obfs](https://github.com/shadowsocks/simple-obfs) instead!

# ABCs

[ptproxy](https://github.com/gumblex/ptproxy) ([author page](https://gumble.tk/ptproxy.html)) obfuscates TCP traffic with the help of Tor's PT ([pluggable transports](/2016/02/28/tor/)) prototol. This tool is independent of Tor and applies to any TCP traffic. In this post, I demonstrate how *ptproxy* obfuscate Shadowsocks traffic.

1. To speed up TCP connection to VPS, try [KCPtun](https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun).
1. Before *ptproxy*

   > app -> Shadowsocks client -> Shadowsocks server -> destination host

2. With *ptproxy*

   > app -> Shadowsocks client -> ptproxy client -> ptproxy server ->  Shadowsocks server -> destination host

   In proxy chain, there are client/server node pairs. But each node (named as client or server) actually plays another pair of client/server functionalities at the same instant/simutaneously/concurrently. Each node forwards requests while listens for incoming request.

   The former client/server refer to literal name of chain node, while the later pair are that node's functionalities. A server functionality address is set at your will while a client functionality address must be set to address a server functionality.
3. In this post, assume client resides on localhost while servers resides on VPS.
4. New **Async** version requirs *>=python=3.4*. The ancient shell script version is deprecated.

# Python3.4 on CentOS 6.5

```bash
# cd /var/tmp
# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.4/Python-3.4.4.tgz
# tar vxzf Python-3.4.4.tgz
# cd Python-3.4.4
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
# make && make altinstall
# python3.4 -V
# ln -sv /usr/local/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python3.4
# rm Python-3.4.4.tgz
```

# Configuration sample

```json
{
    "role": "server",
    "state": ".",
    "local": "127.0.0.1:1080",
    "server": "0.0.0.0:23456",
    "ptexec": "obfs4proxy -logLevel ERROR -enableLogging",
    "ptname": "obfs4",
    "ptargs": "cert=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;iat-mode=0",
    "ptserveropt": "",
    "ptproxy": ""
}
```

1. It's localhost part (client) and VPS part (server).
2. A directory to store *ptproxy* running states consisting of several Json files.

   We should modify *obfs4_state.json* to switch *iat-mode*.
3. *local* literally must be a *loopback* address (*127.0.0.1:port*), traffic within localhost.

   For *ptproxy client* role, the loopback address is set (at your will) listening for local request. But for *ptproxy server*, it is an address to which traffic is forwarded.
4. Similarly, *server* parameter should be an address for remote connection.

   For *ptproxy client* role, the remote address is set to *ptproxy server*'s listening address on VPS which is, in return, equal to *ptproxy server*'s *server* argument.
5. That's the *pluggable transport* executable.
6. *ptname* should be unique for each *ptproxy* client/server pair.
7. For *ptproxy* server, ignore this.
8. *ptserveropt* and *ptproxy* are usually left alone.

# Server

1. Get *ptproxy*

   ```bash
   # cd /opt/
   # git clone --branch master --depth 1 https://github.com/gumblex/ptproxy.git
   # git clone --branch master --depth 1 https://github.com/nibrag/aiosocks.git
   # cd ptproxy/
   # ln -sv /opt/aiosocks/aiosocks aiosocks
   ```

   I don't like 3rd-party code snippets (Aiosocks here) mingled with system packages. Just put it together with *ptproxy*.
2. Server configuration

   ```bash
   # cd ptproxy
   # cp example.json server.json
   # vim server.json
   ```

   *ptproxy* server listens on VPS for incoming *ptproxy* client traffic while forwards that to Shadowsocks server.

   ```json
   {
       "role": "server",
       "state": "/opt/ptproxy/pt_state",
       "local": "127.0.0.1:5555",
       "server": "0.0.0.0:5554",
       "ptexec": "/usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy -logLevel ERROR -enableLogging",
       "ptname": "obfs4",
       "ptargs": "cert=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;iat-mode=0",
       "ptserveropt": "",
       "ptproxy": ""
   }
   ```

   1. The *json* configuration file does not allow comments. Remove them before launching.
   2. Do NOT use bash reserving words in configuration, i.e. `${HOME}` which is unkown to *ptproxy*.
3. Initial server startup

   ```sh
   ~ # cd /opt/ptproxy/
   ~ # mkdir pt_state; chown -R nobody: pt_state
   ~ # su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "python3.4 ptproxy.py -s server.json"
   ```

   >Must make sure *nobody* has *write* access to *pt_state* directory.

   This is the very first launch. `su nobody -s /bin/bash` drop user to *nobody* instead of *root*. Useful information is printed on stdout for client side.

   ```
   2015-10-02 18:16:49 Starting PT…
   ===== Server information =====
   “server": “xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyy",
   “ptname": “obfs4″,
   “ptargs": “cert=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;iat-mode=0″,
   ==============================
   2015-10-02 18:16:49 PT started successfully.
   ```

   Meanwhile three state files are generated under */opt/ptproxy/pt_state*. *obfs4_state.json* need modification for *iat-mode*, which means *inter-arrival time* controlling whether to confuscate packets' sending time by padding bits. By default, it is turned off.

   In order to be more robust, change to 1 (Enabled, ScrambleSuit-style with bulk throughput optimizations) or 2 (Paranoid, Each IAT write will send a length sampled from the length distribution. This may slow down performance). Details refer to [ Various IAT related changes](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2014-August/079402b.html). *iat-mode* of Tor bridges is turned off by default either.
4. *iat-mode*

   To modify *obfs4_state.json*, the running instance must be killed first.

   ```bash
   # pkill -f "ptproxy.py"
   ```

   Attention, on the server side, modify *obfs4_state.json*. Leave *server.json* alone.
5. Real launch by *rc.local*

   Add to */etc/rc.local* (symlink to */etc/rc.d/rc.local*) on CentOS:

   ```sh
   #!/bin/sh
   # /etc/rc.local

   PT_DIR="/opt/ptproxy"
   /bin/su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/python3.4 ${PT_DIR}/ptproxy.py -s ${PT_DIR}/server.json &"
   ```

   To check the shell syntax, add `set -x` to the beginning of *rc.local* and *sh /etc/rc.local*. Errors will be printed.

   If this is the only shell commands in *rc.local*, just execute `sh /etc/rc.local`. Otherwise, reboot VPS. It's not recommended to launch *ptproxy* server directly on SSH terminal, which may result in service killed occasionally.

# *ptproxy* client

```bash
# cd /opt/
# git clone --branch master --depth 1 https://github.com/gumblex/ptproxy.git
# git clone --branch master --depth 1 https://github.com/nibrag/aiosocks.git
# cd ptproxy/
# ln -sv /opt/aiosocks/aiosocks aiosocks
```

1. Client configuration

   Edit *ss-client.json*:

   ```json
   {
       "role": "client",
       "state": "/opt/ptproxy/pt_state",
       "local": "127.0.0.1:5553",
       "server": "ip-of-vps:5554",
       "ptexec": "/usr/local/bin/obfs4proxy -logLevel ERROR -enableLogging",
       "ptname": "obfs4",
       "ptargs": "cert=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA;iat-mode=0",
       "ptserveropt": "",
       "ptproxy": ""
   }
   ```

   The *ptname* and *ptargs* should be set according to the initial server launch output. If choose to change *iat-mode*, remember to update local *obfs4_state.json* as well.
2. Shadowsocks client's side configuration

   ```json
   {
       "server":"127.0.0.1",
       "server_port":5553,
       "local_address": "127.0.0.1",
       "local_port":1080,
       "password":"gh1Tsy71nw",
       "timeout":300,
       "method":"aes-256-cfb",
       "fast_open":false
   }
   ```

   Change the *server* and *server_port* to *ptproxy*'s counterparts.
3. Iptables

   Turn on *ptproxy*'s server listening port

   ```
   # iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT 4 -d server-ip -p tcp -m multiport --dports 5554,5555 -j RETURN
   # iptables -I OUTPUT 5 -d server-ip -p tcp -m multiport --dports 5554,5555 -j RETURN
   ```

   5555 is Shadowsocks server port (just in case we turn off *ptproxy*) while 5554 is *ptproxy* server port.

   Choose the -I *rulenum* based on your case.
4. Client startup

   ```bash
   # cd ~/ptproxy/ptproxy
   # su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "python3.4 ptproxy.py -c client.json"
   ```

5. Client startup script

   ```bash
   #!/sbin/openrc-run
   # To obfsucating TCP traffic, esepcially for SOCKS5 Shadowsocks

   PT_DIR="/opt/ptproxy"

   depend() {
     after net.wlp3s0
     after net.enp0s25
     after dhcpcd
     before shadowsocks
   }

   start() {
     if [ "${RC_CMD}" = "restart" ];
     then
       ebegin "Waiting"
       eend $?
     fi

     ebegin "Starting ptproxy"

     if ! pgrep -u nobody -x -f "/usr/bin/python3.4 ${PT_DIR}/ptproxy.py -c ${PT_DIR}/client.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/python3.4 ${PT_DIR}/ptproxy.py -c ${PT_DIR}/client.json >/dev/null &"
     fi

     eend $?
   }

   stop() {
     ebegin "Stoping ptproxy"

     if pgrep  -u nobody -x -f "/usr/bin/python3.4 ${PT_DIR}/ptproxy.py -c ${PT_DIR}/client.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       pkill -TERM -u nobody -f "/usr/bin/python3.4 ${PT_DIR}/ptproxy.py -c ${PT_DIR}/client.json"
     fi

     eend $?
   }
   ```

   It's recommended to merge this init script with Shadowsocks init script.

# Notes

1. A *ptproxy* client instance is associated with a server instance by argument *ptname*.

   That is to say, a client/server pair are for one application's TCP obfuscation (Shadowsocks in this post).
2. If want to obfuscate another application's TCP traffic, we should launch another pair of client/server instances with a new pair of client/server configuration files.

   Specially, change the *state* location. We may use another PT binary like *obfsproxy/obfs3*. We also should choose new port client/server ports etc. Most important, choose new *ptname*.
3. If Tor is used with Bridges and PT. Likely an instance of *obfsproxy/obfs4proxy* exists on you local host. This time the Tor serves *ptproxy*'s role.
4. Run as *nobody*:
   1. su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "script here";
   2. Make sure *nobody* have *write* access to *pt_state* directory.
