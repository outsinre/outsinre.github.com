>This post describe customzing *android-x86-4.4-r5.iso* and using tips. Regarding the installation, please refer to [virtualbox post](/2015/08/21/virtualbox).

# Customization

1. Download [android-x86-4.4-r5.iso](http://www.android-x86.org/).
2. Mount ISO.

   ```bash
   ~ # mount -t loop /path/to/android-x86-4.4-r5.iso /mnt/android-x86
   ```

   Get *system.sfs* which is a Squashfs (compressed read-only for Linux) that containing the Android */system* partition - our customzation target in this post.
3. Mount Squashfs.

   ```bash
   ~ # mount -t squashfs -o loop /path/to/system.sfs /mnt/squashfs
   # Or make sure *sys-fs/squashfs-tools* is installed
   ~ # unsquashfs [-ll] -d /mnt/squashfs /mnt/android-x86/system.sfs
   ```

   There exists only one file *system.img* which is the original *ext4* filesystem of Android */system*. That is to say, the author first create Android */system* partition as IMG and then compress it as Squashfs.
4. Mount IMG.

   ```bash
   ~ # mount -t ext4 -o loop,rw /path/to/system.img /mnt/img
   # Cannot modify if mount directly from Squashfs
   ~ # mount -t ext4 -o loop /mnt/squashfs/system.img /mnt/img
   ```

   Do customization here. For example, remove LatinIME, SetupWizard etc. etc. Especially for *build.prop*:

   ```
   # change values
   dalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m
   dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=150m
   dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
   # disable the first initialization SetupWizard.
   ro.setupwizard.mode=DISABLED
   # append these two lines to end
   dalvik.vm.execution-mode=int:fast
   ro.sf.lcd_density=96
   ```

   >DPI is set to 96 (default value of coomputer screen). Can be changed on-the-fly; please read the Tips part.

   Customization finished. Then we should re-pack the ISO file.
5. Do **NOT** unmount.

   Since custiomization finished, intuitively, we should `umount /mnt/img`, which is fine but far from perfect. For example, we cannot set a smaller (read the next step `-l 700M`) */system* size although we removed bunch of built-in apks.

   What we should do is to creating a new IMG.
6. New IMG

   >*make_ext4fs* and *simg2img* can be get (or manually compiled) from the 1st reference (链啊啊接: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1dEZjGfJ 密啊啊码: fyd4).

   ```bash
   ~ # cd /mnt
   # creating new IMG from /mnt/img
   ~ # make_ext4fs -l 700M -s -a system system_sparse.img /mnt/img
   # Convert Android sparse images to raw images
   ~ # simg2img system_sparse.img system_raw.img
   ~ # mv system_raw.img system.img; rm system_sparse.img
   ~ # ll system.img
   ```

   1. 'l': new smaller IMG size.
   2. 's': sparse mode to compress IMG file.
   3. 'a': mount point at Android.
   4. Check the new image file size, it's exactly 700M.

   >Not sure yet. If we omit 's' argument, then *simg2img* is optionally (as we don't require *sparse* in Android-x86). But remember IMG in Android-x86 ISO is RAW image. If you are handling an Android ROM image, please *simg2img* to remove *sparse* before mounting.

7. New Squashfs

   >We cannot mount Squashfs as *rw*. Must create Squashfs like IMG above.

   ```bash
   ~# cd /mnt
   ~ # mksquashfs system.img system.sfs
   ```

8. Re-pack ISO

   >We cannot *mount* ISO as *rw*. Though we can use Archive manager to modify ISO contents, *bootable* information gets lost meanwhile, resulting in ISO unbootable.

   We will use *mkisofs* from *app-cdr/cdrtools* to re-pack ISO, before which we must replace the *system.fs*.

   ```bash
   ~ # cd /mnt
   # copy all the ISO files to a new directory
   ~ # cp -aR /mnt/android-x86 cust_android-x86
   ~ # diff -r  /mnt/android-x86 cust_android-x86
   ~ # cp system.sfs cust_android-x86/ (optional if you use Archive manager)
   ~ # cd cust_android-x86/
   ~ # mkisofs -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -eltorito-alt-boot [-input-charset utf-8] -V "Android-x86-4.4-r5" -JTrl -o ../cust_android-x86.iso ./
   ```

   Use `-r` instead of `-R`. `-r` means that we want to use Rockridge extensions. The `-R` command line option also achieves this but in a less satisfactory way. `-R` maintains the UID and GID of each file's owner. The same UID and GID will more than likely be meaningless once the files are transported over to another system, so ownership of all files in the ISO image is set to *root:root* if we use `-r` instead of `-R`. Also, `-R` preserves file permissions, including the *write* flags. Having any of the *write* flags set for a file on a read-only media doesn't make much sense, so `-r` resets it in the filesystem image.

# Tips

>By switching to virtual terminal (F1 - F6), we get *root* shell.

## Shutdown

```bash
# https://sourceforge.net/p/android-x86/kernel/ci/kernel-4.4/tree/kernel/reboot.c
# Alt-F1
~ # reboot -f/p (shutdown)
~ # reboot (reboot)
```

## Reset

```bash
# Alt-F1
~ # rm -R /data
````

## DPI

```bash
~ $ su
~ # wm density
~ # wm density 200 && reboot
```

Adjust the value as you wish.

## [Double Mouse](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/android-x86/0XmX3b0f1IE/discussion)

To remove the *duplicate mouse* issue, firstly, set VM mouse device to *usbtablet*:

```bash
~ $ vboxmanage modifyvm Android-x86 --mouse usbtablet
```

You may found one of the mouse changes to draggable *circle*. Then, we further create an [Input Device Configuration](https://source.android.com/devices/input/input-device-configuration-files) file for the *usbtablet*.

Get into Android terminal:

```
~ $ su
~ # cd /system/usr/idc
~ # dumpsys input | less
```

From the output of *dumpsys input* you can easily find the Virtualbox Usbtablet device however the *devicetype* is *pointer* instead of correct *touchscreen*. What we do is to create a configureation under */system/usr/idc* to tell Android how to use the device correctly.

The configureation file can be grabbed from *Android-x86-4.4-r5.iso* system (*/system/usr/idc/GenericTouch.idc*). If you want to skip all that trouble, here is it:

# Basic Parameters
touch.deviceType = touchScreen
#touch.orientationAware = 1

# Touch Size
touch.touchSize.calibration = default

# Tool Size
touch.toolSize.calibration = default

# Pressure
touch.pressure.calibration = default

# Size
touch.size.calibration = default

# Orientation
touch.orientation.calibration = none

device.internal = 1
```

We should change the filename to `Vendor_XXXX_Product_XXXX_Version_XXXX.idc` as directed, where `XXXX` comes out of *dumpsys input* output.

Put the newly created file to */system/usr/idc*. **Attention**, make sure the file has *read* permission.

```
~ # chmod 644 Vendor_XXXX_Product_XXXX_Version_XXXX.idc
```
