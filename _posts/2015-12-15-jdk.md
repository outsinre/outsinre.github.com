# ABCs

1. We use Java Development Kits (JDKs) for Java development (programming) while Java Runtime Environments (JREs) for Java application running.

    JRE is enclosed in JDK and there is no need to install JRE extrally.
2. Java version: 6 -> 7 -> 8. Currently, version 7 is most widely deployed.
2. Gentoo provides numerous JREs and JDKs like *IcedTea Open Java SE*, *Oracle's Java 7/8 SE*, *Sun's Java 6 SE*, *IBM Java SE* etc.

    Oracle's Java is previously called Sun Java (<= version 6) which was acquisited by Oracle. IcedTea can be consireded a 'distribution' of OpenJDK: it provides fully open-source build tools for it.
3. Oracle Java 8 SE is released but some new features make it incompatible with old versions, causing a few Java applications cannot run under Oracle Java 8 JRE.

    What is worse, Oracle Java 7 SE is vulnerable in spite of its efforts in patches. If you really like Oracle's Java, use version 8 instead!
4. The preferred JDK is *IcedTea Open Java SE* (version 8 is not released yet) which is the default Java SE on Linux system.

# IcedTea Open Java SE

1. *IcedTea Open Java SE* is the default Java SE on most Linux system, including Gentoo. To install, just try:

    ```bash
    ~ # emerge -pvt virtual/jdk
    or
    ~ # emerge -pvt virtual/jre
    ```

# Oracle's Java SE

Though Oracle Java SE is unfavorable, this is the main focus on steps in emerging *restrictive* packages.

**In real life, DO NOT install Oracle Java 7 SE**!

2. Oracle Java SE is a *fetch-restricted* package, thus need a few extra steps to *emerge*. For instance, we should manually download the *distfile* at first. Try:

    ```bash
    ~ # emerge -pvt oracle-jdk-bin:1.7
    ```
    Slot 1.7 means Java 7 while 1.8 refers to Java 8. Likely:

    ```
    These are the packages that would be merged, in reverse order:

    Fetch instructions for dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin-1.7.0.80:
     * 
     * Oracle requires you to download the needed files manually after
     * accepting their license through a javascript capable web browser.
     * 
     * Download the following files:
     *   jdk-7u80-linux-x64.tar.gz
     * at 'http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html#jdk-7u80-oth-JPR'
     * and move them to '/usr/portage/distfiles'
     * 
     * If the above mentioned urls do not point to the correct version anymore,
     * please download the files from Oracle's java download archive:
     * 
     *    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html#jdk-7u80-oth-JPR
    ```
    Go to the specified URL of *ebuild*, download *jdk-7u80-linux-x64.tar.gz* and put it under */usr/portage/distfiles*.
3. Accept the `Oracle-BCLA-JavaSE` license.

    ```
    # /etc/portage/package.license/oracle-jdk-bin
    # required by oracle-jdk-bin (argument)
    dev-java/oracle-jdk-bin:1.7 Oracle-BCLA-JavaSE
    ```
4. Emerge

    ```bash
    # emerge -av oracle-jdk-bin:1.7
    ```
5. Notes
    1. Don't add `nsplugin` USE flag. Java plugin is now almost dead and vulnerable when browsing the Internet.
    
# Configuring

1. A package *java-config* is installed alongside the JDK, which serves the same goal as Gentoo's *eselect* utility to choose JDK slots.
2. Using the *java-config* / *eselect* tool with root privileges, a system-wide default java virtual machine (VM) can be set. Of course, you can also use *java-config* / *eselect* to customize their personal VM on a user-by-user basis. 

    ```bash
    java-config --help
    java-config -L
    java-config [-S | -s] vm
    or
    eselect java-vm help
    eselect java-vm list
    eselect java-vm show
    eselect java-vm set [ system | user] vm
    ```
3. `JAVA_HOME` etc. is set automatically by */etc/profile.d/java-config-2.sh* script from *ebuild*.

# Practice

1. You can install the Oracle 8 alongside IcedTea 7.
2. Set system-vm to IcedTea 7 while set normal user-vm to Oracle 8.  IcedTea 7 is stable and widely compatible while Oracle 8 assumes new Java features.

    ```bash
    ~ $ eselect java-vm list
    Available Java Virtual Machines:
      [1]   icedtea-bin-7  system-vm
      [2]   oracle-jdk-bin-1.8  user-vm
    ~ $ eselect java-vm set user 2
    # eselect java-vm set system 1
    ```
    Note: you cannot set user-vm under root account (root uses system-vm).
