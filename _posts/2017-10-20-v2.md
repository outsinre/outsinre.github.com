1. JSON comments (`//foo` or `/* bar */`) are accepted by V2.
2. Encryption between Nginx and backend V2 can be abandoned.
3. Cloudflare now provides free websocket caching service. You cannot camouflage the Host header  when Cloudflare CDN is turned on.
4. Before launching the service, use *V2 -test -config config.json* to check JSON syntax.

# Installation #

Just extract the Zip archive.

```bash
~ # unzip /path/to/v2ray.zip -d /opt/v2ray/
~ # mkdir -p /opt/v2ray/log
~ # chown -R nobody: /opt/v2ray/
```

As we will run the service as *nobody*, so make sure the directory and files onwership is correct.

# Server Configuration

Refer to backup.

1. The 'listen' address of 'inbounds' should be '127.0.0.1' instead of '0.0.0.0', disallowing external direct access.

## Nginx Template ##

```
location /V2 {
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10086;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    #proxy_intercept_errors on;
    #error_page 400 502 = /;
}
```

A side effect when browsing '/V2', brwoser reports "400 Bad Request" as the backend V2 is a websocket server instead of a bare HTTP server. We may also receive "502 Bad Gateway" as the backend V2 is not started yet.

## proxy\_intercept\_errors

Add the following code to '/V2' location:

```
proxy_intercept_errors on;
error_page 400 /404.html;
error_page 502 /50x.html;
```

The code will return '404.html' page when the backend code is 400. We can also return other URI:

```
error_page 400 502 = /;
```

The code does internal redirect and the symbol `=` makes the new response code equal to that of the new page. This method is always preferred. A more robust method would be:

```
proxy_intercept_errors on;

error_page 400 404 /404.html;
location = /404.html {
    internal;
}

error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
location = /50x.html {
    internal;
}
```

The *internal* specifies that a given location can only be used for internal redirects. External browser requests to the '/V2' URI would respond "404 (Not Found)" to end users.

Alternatively, try the next method in section [Customize HTTP Header](#customize-http-header).

## Customize HTTP Header ##

Unlike the section [Nginx Template](#nginx-template), we can `proxy_pass` based on customized HTTP headers under the '/' location, using the *if* directive. This method requires V2 client to be 2.40.2 or above.

```
ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem;

location / {
    root /var/www;
  
    proxy_redirect off;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
  
    if ( $http_host = "howareyou" ) {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10086;
}
```

The template above uses customized 'Host' header to redirect requests to backend. The customized Host header **must not** be the website domain. Otherwise, all normal HTTP traffic goes to backend as well. Usually, we set it to a public domain like *www.amazon.com*. As you will, it can be any arbitrary strings, like *howareyou*.

Modify V2 configuration accordingly:

```
"wsSettings": {
  "path": "/",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "howareyou"
  }
}
```

Manually manipulate the 'Host' header is not recommended as it is crucial for vhost matching. If V2 supports self-defined header, then it is far more desirable. By the way, it rerquires the [evil if directive](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/depth/ifisevil/). Actually, we can also redirect based on the 'Upgrade' header:

```
if ( $http_upgrade = "websocket" ) {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:10086;
}
```

This method does not require special V2 *wsSettings* but still uses the *if* directive.

## SELinux and Firewall ##

On servers with SELinux on, V2ray may report [websocket: bad handshake](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/issues/2451). By default, SELinux [does not permit Nginx operations](https://www.nginx.com/blog/using-nginx-plus-with-selinux/), such as proxying to upstream locations or [communicating with other processes through sockets](https://stackoverflow.com/q/27435655).

Then make sure:

```bash
~ # grep 'denied.*nginx' /var/log/audit/audit.log
~ # getsebool -a

~ # setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

Also make sure, port 443 is open to the Internet.

## Test the Server ##

```bash
~ # sudo -u nobody -g nobody -- /opt/v2ray/v2ray -config /opt/v2ray/config.json
~ # ss -nplt
~ # tail -F /opt/v2ray/log/{access,error}.log
~ # tail -F /var/log/nginx/{access,error}.log
```

# Client Configuration

Refer to backup.

As TLS encryption is adopted, extra Vmess encryption is unnecessary unless Cloudflare CDN is adopted. Details refer to *Cloudflare CDN* section.

## sniffing

This option is used by *inbound* or *inbounddetour* to retrieve domains upon receiving IP packets. Usually, users connect to a domain instead of an IP. Most of the time V2 *inbound* or *inbounddetour* receives the domain (as DNS query first) such that relevant traffic is directed in accord with *domain* rules of the *routing* section.

However, it happens that a client may connect to an IP directly (i.e. Telegram). What is worse, IP packets can bypass *domain* rules.

Additionally, if a user forgets to select:

>Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5

in Firefox setting, DNS queries would be sent to local DNS service and then IP packets go to V2. Obviously, local DNS replies are usually poisoned.

Therefore, *sniffing* comes to help such that it siniffs domains from IP packets, reset the connection, and route against *domain* rules. DNS poision issue is resolved as well.

From the discussion, we find *routing* based on IP packet sniffing is more reliable and robust. In the meantime, *dokodemo* transparent proxy redirects IP packets based on Iptables.

## DNS

A DNS schema:

1. Disable "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5" in Firefox.
2. DNS queries go to local Dnsmasq.
3. Blocked domains queries go to Dokodemo.
4. Unblocked domains queries go to ISP.

# Cloudflare CDN

Turn on CDN to hide server IP from censorship and probably accelerate speed.

Cloudflare supports caching *websocket* traffic for free accounts. To enable Cloudflare CDN on V2, just click the orange symbol on DNS record.

You might wait for a while before the DNS setting comes into effect. Check by `dig your.domain.com` and find the returned IP be that of Cloudflare's CDN servers.

A few notes:

1. Cloudflare's free CDN service actually *degrade* instead of *accelerate* your service.

   This can be caused by ISP dropping IP packets to its servers. What's worse, Cloudflare may do this on purpose for paid service.
2. Once enabled, you **must** reset Customized HTTP headers the real domain name instead of *howareyou*.

   Otherwise, V2 client cannot establish TLS session with Cloudflare as CDN servers does not have a *howareyou* vhost.
3. Vmess encryption **must** be enabled besides TLS, thus Cloudflare cannot decrypt Vmess payload.

   You'd better not use V2 do confidential communication such as Email, Login etc.

# Systemd

From now on, V2 provides built-in Systemd unit file. Before enable the unit, please update it use *nobody* account instead of the *root*. Finally, it may look like:

```
[Unit]
Description=V2Ray Service
Documentation=https://www.v2ray.com/ https://www.v2fly.org/
After=network.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nobody
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
NoNewPrivileges=true
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/chown -R nobody:nobody /opt/v2ray/
ExecStart=/opt/v2ray/v2ray -config /opt/v2ray/config.json
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then we can enable and start the service:

```bash
~ # systemctl daemon-reload
~ # systemctl enable /opt/v2ray/systemd/v2ray.service
~ # systemctl start v2ray.service
~ # systemctl status v2ray.service
```
