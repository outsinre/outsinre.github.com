> Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a method that simplify identification to NickServ as the first step after connecting to IRC servers, before anything else happens. To connect to freenode using Tor, SASL is required. In this post, I will take Weechat and Freenode for example.

# ABCs

1. Conncet through WebChat on browser.

   Just fill in nick and channel names on [freenode webchat](https://webchat.freenode.net). HTTPS (ssl) establish a secure connection IRC server compared to HTTP.

   By Webchat, we cannot require other services.
2. Connect in the clear.

   Similar to Webchat, the clear way connects directly without proxy or nick reservation (by NickServ).

   Should provide IRC hostname (*chat.freenode.net*) and port (6697) which are implicit in Webchat (*webchat.freenode.net* and 80).

   After connection, join a channel to talk.
3. Connect through Clients (Weechat Irssi etc.).
4. Nickserv - register/identify

   Reserve and identify your nick name.
5. SASL authentication

   Automatic identification on connection by SASL. Weechat SASL supports different authentication mechanisms:

   - plain: plain text file password (default)
   - ecdsa-nist256p-challenge: challenge with public/private key
   - external: self-signed SSL certificate
   - ...
6. Connect with proxy (i.e. Tor).
7. [BNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_%28network%29) (i.e. ZNC), or Weechat relay protocol.

   Weechat relay supports IRC protocol as well (to be compatibile with other IRC clients).

# Style

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ weechat
```

1. *iset*

   ```
   /script search iset
   Alt + i
   /save
   /iset
   ```

   */save* after changes. WeeChat also saves your up-to-date configuration any time you exit the program.
   
   From now on, manage WeeChat configurations by *iset* script.
2. Some specific server commands (i.e. */ns*) are not standard and cannot be recoginized by IRC client.

   ```
   irc.network.send_unknown_commands on
   ```

3. This will close the *buffer* (or called *tab*) immediately when *part*ing a channel.

   ```
   irc.look.part_closes_buffer on
   ```
   
4. By default, *server* and *core* buffers are merged together. Use `Ctrl+x` to tear apart or:

   ```
   irc.look.server_buffer independent
   ```

# Security

1. SSL

   ```
   irc.server_default.ssl on
   irc.server_default.ssl_verify on
   irc.server_default.sasl_mechanism external
   ```
   
   The client verify the server certificate and also the server needs to verify the client certificate - mutual authentication!
2. Turn off *ctcp* to prevent others from querying IRC client information.

   ```
   *ctcp*  ""
   *ctcp* off
   ```

3. Message

   ```
   irc.server_default.msg_part ""
   irc.server_default.msg_quit ""
   ```

# server_default

Some extra optional default server arguments.

```
irc.server_default.nicks ""
irc.server_default.username ""
irc.server_default.realname ""
```

# Server

```
/server add freenode chat.freenode.net/6697 -ssl
/set irc.server.freenode.nicks "username"
/connect freenode
```

Check *server_default* section of *~.weechat/irc.conf*. Common default server options can be set here (i.e. *irc.server_default.ssl*).

# NickServ

*NickServ* allows users to register nicks on IRC servers. Different IRC servers support different set of NickServ commands. We can check by `/msg nickserv help` beforehand. Make sure you are connected to IRC server with your desired nick by */nick new-nick* command.

Don't execute the following commands in a channel tab, otherwise sensitive information (i.e. password) might be disposed and sniffed. All IRC commands are case-insensitive.

Take Freenode for example:

1. `/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> youremail@example.com`

   In Weechat, the *pasword youremail@example.com* part will be displayed as asterisks. But don't worry as long as you put a space between *password* and *youremail@example.com*.

   After this command, Weechat will show *password* and *youremail@example.com* as plain text. IRC server uses the current nick (*username*) as the account name. So *username* is both the nick and account name registered on *freenode*. This special nick is called *primary nick*.

   In a while, you will receive an email, from which you should copy the verification command to complete the registration process:
2. `/msg nickserv confirm <temporary-code>` or `/msg nickserv verify register <username> <temporary-code>`

   This *temporary-code* is only for account registration confirm.

   Now, account name *username* has just one nick *username* associated on Freenode server, no one else can use nick *username* unless the correct *password* is identified (talked later on).

   OFTC server does need this extra confirmation step.
3. `/msg NickServ SET HIDE EMAIL ON`

   To keep your email address private, rather than displaying it publicly, mark it as hidden.

   For OFTC, it's */msg nickserv set private on*.
4. Group more nicks account.

   A Freenode account can reserve multiple nicks. First switch to a new nick and then *group* it to our account (as long as that nick is not reserved by others). Grouping nicks in this way gives you the benefit of having all your nicks covered by the same [unaffiliated cloak](#unaffiliated-cloak). The default group name is the account name, namely *username*.

   ```
   # switch to nick "username_"
   /nick username_
    
   /msg nickserv group
    ```
    
   To remove a nick from your account:

   ```
   /nick username
   /msg nickserv ungroup username_
   ```

5. `/reconnect`

   It will prompt like *username is registered... you must identify yourself...*. To identify yourself as nick *username*:

   ```
   /msg NickServ identify username <password>
   ```

# Identification

## Manually Identification

If you don't configure SASL, then you have two choices:

1. Manual identification after connection to server as above.

   ```
   /reconnect freenode
   
   /msg NickServ identify username <password> # freenode
   /msg NickServ identify <password> username # oftc
   ```

2. Use *freenode.command* to run *identify*.

   ```
   irc.server.freenode.command "/msg NickServ identify username <password>"
   ```

   *freenode.command* runs a command automatically once connected to the server.

## SASL plain scheme

OFTC disallow this scheme.

1. `irc.server.freenode.sasl_mechanism plain`
2. `set irc.server.freenode.sasl_username username`

   The username can be any one of your grouped nicks. But usually the primary nick (namely the account name) is used.
2. `/secure set freenode <password>`

   Password will be recorded in *~/.weechat/sec.conf*.
3. `irc.server.freenode.sasl_password "${sec.data.freenode}"`

   Tell *weechat* where to get the password.
4. `irc.server.freenode.sasl_fail disconnect`

   If SASL auth fail, disconnect.

## SASL external scheme

1. `irc.server.freenode.sasl_mechanism external`

   As long as *sasl_mechanism* is changed to *external*, *sasl_username* and *sasl_password* setting won't take effect.
2. `irc.server.freenode.ssl_cert "%h/ssl/freenode.pem"`

   We should generate a self-signed X509 certificate before `/reconnect`.

### irc.pem

OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the SSL/TLS protocols and related cryptography libraries. Virtually, almost any packages using SSL/TLS require OpenSSL support, OpenSSH and Firefox (HTTPS) included.

The *openssl* program is a command line tool from OpenSSL, providing various cryptography functions. In this post, it will used to genrate self-signed X509 certificate.

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout irc.pem -sha256 -x509 -days 365 -out irc.pem -subj "/C=USA/ST=NewYork/L=NewYork/O=UST/OU=CS/CN=IRC"
jim@laptop ~ $ mkdir -p ~/.weechat/ssl
jim@laptop ~ $ mv irc.pem ~/.weechat/ssl/
```

1. req: certificate request and certificate generating utility.
2. nodes: no DES encryption. The RSA private key won't be encrypted by DES.
3. keyout: the private key file.
4. sha256: the digest to sign certificate.
5. out: the certificate file.

   The *keyout* and *out* specify the same output file name, which means private key and certificate will be merged automatically.
6. subj: certificate Subject field. If not provided on command line, *openssl* will prompt for user input.

### Nick and Certificate Association

To achieve certificate authentication, we should add the certificate's SHA1 fingerprint to NickServ on freenode server

Get the SHA1 fingerpring:

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ man x509
jim@laptop ~ $ openssl x509 -noout -text -sha256 -fingerprint -in freenode.pem
```

Add the fingerprint:

```
/whois nick
/msg nickserv cert list
/msg nickserv cert add/del [sha1]

/reconnect
```

The fingerprint value can be ommited and NickServ on the server will automatically calculate the value.

Finally reconnect to identify nick by SASL external. You can see a line:

>gnutls: sending one certificate

during connection. Run */whois nick* to see:

>has client certificate fingerprint: <your fingerprint here>

### Renew certificate

Upon expiration, we need to renew the certificate. Acutally, renewing is to create a new certificate herein.

```bash
# Extract private key from certification file (PEM)
~ # openssl rsa -in irc.pem -out irc.key
# Extract public certificate from certification file (PEM)
~ # openssl x509 -in irc.pem -out irc.crt
# Converts the certificate into a certificate request (PEM)
~ # openssl x509 -x509toreq -in irc.crt -out irc.csr -signkey irc.key
# Create a new certification for one year
~ # openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in irc.csr -out irc.crt.new -signkey irc.key
# Concatenate the new certificate and original key
~ # cat irc.crt.new irc.key > irc.pem.new
# Chceck validity
~ # openssl x509 -noout -text -in irc.pem.new
```

Remember to add the new certificate's fingerprint to IRC server and del the old one.

# Unaffilicated Cloak

1. Unaffiliated Cloak is to hide your IP from IRC channels.
2. To obtain a cloak, just join the official `#freenode` channel, ask for one there and reconnect.

   When channel staff notices your request, you *might* get cloaked. Unaffiliated Cloak applies to all channels on Freenode server.
3. To get a cloak on OFTC is much easier:

   ```
   /msg nickserv SET CLOAK ON
   ```

The above method is now deprecated! Freenode automatically turns on cloak (vHost) for every account. Just run command `/msg HOSTSERV ON`. Checking by `/whois <username>`. Before and after:
    
```
# before
(~weechat@joseon-eldv4c.jnih.mqbr.vquou2.IP): weechat
# after
(~weechat@joseon/user/username): weechat
```

# proxy - Tor

Suppose you would like to connect to IRC server by proxy, how to set?

1. Add proxy

   ```
   /proxy add tor socks5 127.0.0.1 9050
   ```

   This will tell Weechat that a proxy named 'tor' is added.
2. Server copy

   Suppose we find Tor proxy is troublesome someday, updates to current server must be restored. To ease configuration, issue the following command:

   ```
   /server copy freenode freenode-tor
   ```

   Update *freenode-tor* configuration instead.
2. Enable proxy for IRC server

   ```
   /set irc.server.freenode-tor.proxy tor
   ```

3. However Freenode does not allow Tor connection to *chat.freenode.net*.

   The server hostname should be changed to hidden url *freenodeok2gncmy.onion* while keeping the original port.

   ```
   /set irc.server.freenode-tor.addresses freenodeok2gncmy.onion/6697
   ```

4. Onion certificate.

   Cannot wait to reconnect? Yeah, me too. The server certificate cannot be verified since onion url is not certified by almost all CAs.

   >gnutls: the hostname in the certificate does NOT match "freenodeok2gncmy.onion"

   Currently, only a few onion url is signed by [digicert](https://www.digicert.com).

   The solution is maully trust fetched certificates in which though the hostname is *freenode.net* instead of *freenodeok2gncmy.onion*.

   When connected to *chat.freenode.net*, Weechat usually receive three certificates with their SHA-1 fingerprints listed. Collect those fingerprints and assign to:

   ```
   /set irc.server.freenode-tor.ssl_fingerprint fp1,fp2,fp3,...
   ```

   Alternatively we can turn off certificate verification:

   ```
   /set irc.server.freenode-tor.ssl_verify off
   ```

   If IRC client supports [**key pinning**](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/chat), we can choose to trust freenode's public key fingerprint instead certificate's fingerprint which benefits us in that the former keep consistent while the later varies in accord with the real freenode server you connect to. Unfortunately, Weechat does not.
   
   If Weechat throws errors like:

   >gnutls: peer's certificate is NOT trusted

   >gnutls: peer's certificate issuer is unknown

   Please check [whether](https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/972) `weechat.network.gnutls_ca_file` is correctly set. On Centos, it should be */etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt*; but on archlinux, it should be */etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt*.

   Recently, freenode Tor servers do not report certificate fingerprint anymore. We can manually print fingerprint by:

   ```bash
   ~ $ torify gnutls-cli --tofu freenodeok2gncmy.onion:6697  --print-cert | openssl x509 -noout -text -sha256 -fingerprint -in /dev/stdin
   ~ $ sed 's/://g' <<< "fingerprint delimited by colons"
   ```

# Relay

To preserve or share IRC message, we can use Bounced Network Connection (BNC) like [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC). ZNC allows connections from different end users and relay message for each of them.

To simplify the setup, we can use the standard IRC relay and its extended version - *weechat relay*. Weechat supports both the *weechat relay* and the standard IRC relay.

If you add a standard IRC relay in Weechat, you can connect to it with any IRC client like HexChat, Irssi etc. The *weechat relay* runs over Websocket and only allows connections from clients that support Websocket like *glowing-bear* or [Weechat android](https://github.com/ubergeek42/weechat-android).

This section demonstrates [the following schema](https://rigtorp.se/notes/weechat/):

1. Create a *weechat relay* instance on a remote server, bound to loopback.
2. Nginx as a reverse proxy.
3. [Glowing-bear](https://latest.glowing-bear.org/) or Weechat-android as the front-end client.

## Weechat Relay

3. Add relay

   ```
   /relay add ipv4.weechat 9000  # plaintext relay without SSL
   /set relay.network.bind_address "127.0.0.1"
   /set relay.network.password MY-RELAY-PASSWORD
   /set relay.network.max_clients 3
   ```

## Nginx Reverse Proxy

1. Nginx HTTPS sample

   ```
   server {
       listen 80;
       ...
       # enforce https
       return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
   }

   server  {
       ...
       ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/fullchain.pem";
       ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/privkey.pem";
       ....
   ```

2. Add nginx proxy

   ```
   # Set connection header based on upgrade header
   map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
       default upgrade;
       '' close;
   }

   # Protect from brute force attack
   limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=weechat:10m rate=5r/m;

   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name irc.example.com;

       return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;

   }

   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name cloud.example.com;

       ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/fullchain.pem";
       ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/irc.example.com/privkey.pem";
       ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
       ssl_session_timeout 10m;
       ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
       ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
	   
	   location /weechat {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:12545;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_header;
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_read_timeout 3600;
            limit_req zone=weechat burst=1 nodelay;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Acutally, We can connect to the *weechat relay* directly as long as it is configured to have a public certificate.
   1. Create a SSL *weechat relay*.
   2. Configure `relay.network.ssl_cert_key` and `sslcertkey`.
   3. To make things even simpler, why not just SSH into the remote server and use Weechat there?
