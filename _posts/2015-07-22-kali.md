First attempt to launch `Kali` system with some basic ideas.

1. [Kali][1] is a `Debian`-based distribution devoted to `Penetration Testing`.

    "the quieter you become, the more you are about to hear"
2. Install `Kali` in *VMWare*.

    Choose customized VMWare images offered by [offensive-security][2] instead of the official ISO. Just extract the `7z` image and launch it from VMWare.
3. Boot warning:
    1. *not starting portmapper is not running*, refer to [How to fix 1][3] and [#17 floor][4]

	    # update-rc.d -f nfs-common remove
	2. *PulseAudio configured for per-user sessions Warning*, refer to [not an issue][5]
	
	    This is not actually an real issue. The real issue lies in the warning message itself.
