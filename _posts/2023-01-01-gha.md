# Workflow #

Workflows are YMAL files located under the `.github/workflows` directory of your GitHub repo.

A workflow has one or more [jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs). Each job has one or more *steps* that execute on a [runner](#runner). Each step is a user-defined Shell script or well-known [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions) like [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout). Workflows can be triggered by one or more [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

Here is an quick illustration of core concepts.

Please refer to [Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

# Runner #

Each GitHub-hosted runner is a new virtual machine (VM) hosted by GitHub with the runner application and other tools preinstalled, and is available with Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems. When you use a GitHub-hosted runner, machine maintenance and upgrades are taken care of for you.

Each workflow job has its own standalone runner and specifies the [types of runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) by `runs-on`.

See more details about runner at [Using GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

# Persist Output #

We can share values among steps of a job, or even among jobs.

1. To share values among steps of a job, please use [GITHUB\_ENV](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#passing-values-between-steps-and-jobs-in-a-workflow).

   `GITHUB_ENV` is an environment variable storing the pathname of a environment file on the runner. We can access it via Shell syntax in `run` steps and GHA syntax in non-Shell context. See [Using the env context to access environment variable values](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#using-the-env-context-to-access-environment-variable-values).
   
   ```
   {% raw %}
   # define in a step
   echo "MY_VAR=myValue" >> $GITHUB_ENV

   # reference in another step
   ${MY_VAR}
   # -or-
   ${{ env.MY_VAR }}
   {% endraw %}
    ```
      
   However, in the well-know [actions/github-script](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/12021/), we access the environment variables via [process.env.my\_var](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_env).
2. To share values among jobs, please try the following methods.
   1. Use environment variable [GITHUB\_OUTPUT](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs) to declare the output of a job. Similar to `GITHUB_ENV` above, but it can only be accessed with GHA syntax.

      ```
      {% raw %}
      # define output1 in a job
      run: echo "my_var=hello" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
      output1: ${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.my_var }}

      # reference output1 in another job
      ${{needs.<job_id>.outputs.output1}}
      {% endraw %}
      ```
      
      Of course, `GITHUB_OUTPUT` can [also](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/55294) be used to share values among steps of a job.
      
      ```
      {% raw %}
      # reference output1 in another step within the same job
      ${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.output1_var }}
      {% endraw %}
      ```

   2. [Storing workflow data as artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts).

# Tokens and Secrets #

1. GitHub tokens, namely Personal Access Tokens, are opaque strings (credentials) defined for your GitHub account at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.
2. GitHub secrets are names declared at organization level, repository level, or repository environment level. Any values (e.g. JSON string) can be assigned to secrets. But to operate the repo, we assign tokens to secrets.

   Once set, secrets are available to workflows via `${{ secrets.SecretName }}`.

   There is a special secret `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` which is automatically issued by GitHub when a workflow is triggered, and you don not need to create this explicitly. It is different from the personal access tokens. Refer to [Automatic token authentication
](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication).

Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).
