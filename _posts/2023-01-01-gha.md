# Workflow #

Workflows are YMAL files located under the `.github/workflows` directory of your GitHub repo.

A workflow has one or more *jobs*. Each job has one or more *steps* that execute on a [runner](#runner). Each step is a user-defined Shell script or well-known [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions) like [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout). Workflows can be triggered by one or more [events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

Here is an quick illustration of core concepts.

Check [Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

# Runner #

Each GitHub-hosted runner is a new virtual machine (VM) hosted by GitHub with the runner application and other tools preinstalled, and is available with Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems. When you use a GitHub-hosted runner, machine maintenance and upgrades are taken care of for you.

Each workflow job has its own standalone runner and specifies the [types of runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) by `runs-on`.

See more details about runner at [Using GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

# Persist Output #

We can share values among steps of a job, or even among jobs.

1. To [share values among steps of a job](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/ci-cd/github-actions/persist.html), please use [GITHUB\_ENV or GITHUB\_OUTPUT](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/55294).
   1. Output variables `GITHUB_OUTPUT` is a GHA feature. We can access to such variables only with GHA syntax.
   
      ```
      {% raw %}
      ${{ steps.<step-id>.outputs.my_var }}
      {% endraw %}
      ```

   2. Environment variables `GITHUB_ENV` is a Shell feature of the runner. We can access to such variables both with Shell syntax or GHA syntax.
   
      ```
      {% raw %}
      $my_var

      ${{ env.my_var }}
      {% endraw %}
      ```
      
      However, in the well-know [actions/github-script](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/12021/), we access the environment variables via [process.env.my\_var](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/process.html#process_process_env).
2. To share values among jobs, please try the following methods.
   1. [Storing workflow data as artifacts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts).
   2. [Defining outputs for jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/defining-outputs-for-jobs).
