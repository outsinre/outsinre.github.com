# [texmf](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/77726)

You will see name _texmf_ everywhere. It stands for TEX and METAFONT (an old language Knuth used to design fonts).

# [Overview](http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html)

To setup a TeX system, you need to do finish two tasks:

1. Install TeX by a distribution, like TeXLive, MiKTeX etc.
2. Manage TeX system by built-in _texconﬁg_ or _tlmgr_ of TeXLive, the later of which is far more powerful.
   1. Install, update, uninstall, backup individual TeX packages.
   2. Change installation options like paper size and source location.

   You can regard _tlmgr_ as package manager similar to _dnf_, _emerge_ etc.
3. Leave TeX installation in a standalone directory. Do not spread it across the LFS.

# Installation

## OS Package Manager

Installation from package manager is a minimal install and may lack some fundamental TeX packages.

### CentOS ###

By default, the XeTeX engin is not installed. Hence, put it on command line too:

```bash
~ $ dnf install texlive texlive-xetex
```

### Archlinux ###

```bash
~ $ pacman -S texlive-most texlive-lang biber
```

## Net Installer

[Net Installer](https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) is recommended by TeXLive, but limited by local bandwidth and is prone to network abrupt.

The advantage by net installer is you get the latest updates.

## DVD ISO

It's recommended to do a _full_ install from [ISO](https://mirror.lzu.edu.cn/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/texlive.iso).

### Preparation

1. Spare at least 10G disk space.
2. Download the ISO (around 5G).
3. Outline the _texmf_ [trees by TeX varaibles](http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-110002.3)

   All of the trees shoulf follow [TeX Directory Structure (TDS)](https://tug.org/tds).

   ```
   TEXDIR, TEXMFROOT (the main TeX directory):
     /usr/local/texlive/2020

   TEXMFDIST, TEXMFMAIN (The principal tree containing the core of TeX):
     /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-dist

   TEXMFLOCAL (directory for site-wide local files):
     /usr/local/texlive/texmf-local
   TEXMFHOME (directory for user-specific files):
     ~/texmf

   TEXMFSYSVAR (directory for variable and automatically generated data):
     /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-var
   TEXMFVAR (personal directory for variable and automatically generated data):
     ~/.texlive2020/texmf-var

   TEXMFSYSCONFIG (directory for local config):
     /usr/local/texlive/2020/texmf-config
   TEXMFCONFIG (personal directory for local config):
     ~/.texlive2020/texmf-config
   ```

   These TeX variables can be overriden by system environment variables like `TEXLIVE_INSTALL_TEXDIR`. Check `install-tl --help` for details.

### Installation from ISO

```bash
~ # mkdir -p /mnt/iso; cd /mnt/iso
~ # mount /path/to/texlive.iso .

# text mode
~ # per ./install-tl

# GUI mode
~ # per ./install-tl -gui
```

Leave the default settings (full installation) if you dunno what you are doing. There is an option:

> create symlinks in standard directories

Please leave it it uncheck, which otherwise may ruin your system _bin_ directories.

It may take half an hour to complete the installation.

### TeX environment variables for Unix

There may exist multiple TeX distributions installed alongside. So, it's better to create a current version symlink.

```bash
~ # cd /usr/local/texlive/
~ # ln -sv 2020 current 
```

Mainly, adjust the search path.

```
PATH=/usr/local/texlive/current/bin/x86_64-linux:$PATH; export PATH
MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/current/texmf-dist/doc/man:$MANPATH; export MANPATH
INFOPATH=/usr/local/texlive/current/texmf-dist/doc/info:$INFOPATH; export INFOPATH
```

### Check Installation Scheme

_tlmgr_ will reveal everythin about the setup.

```bash
~ # tlmgr --help
~ # tlmgr conf

~ # kpsewhich -a texmf.cnf
~ # kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME

~ # kpsewhich foo.sty
~ # kpsewhich bar.cls
```

# Update

It is highly recommened __not__ to update TeX distribution in place. Instead, you'd better install a new distribution version. Alternatively, please update or install individual packages into [TEXMFLOCAL or TEXMFHOME](#additional-packages-and-fonts).

1. Where should we get updates from?

   By default, the

   >after install, set CTAN as source for package updates

   option is checked upon installation.

   But we can manually set the update repository afterwards:

   ```
   ~ # tlmgr option repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet
   ```

   This tells tlmgr to use a nearby CTAN mirror for future updates.
2. [How to update](http://tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-450005.2)?

   ```
   # GUI
   ~ # tlmgr -gui

   # Text
   ~ # tlmgr update -all -dry-run
   ~ # tlmgr update -list

   ~ # tlmgr update -all
   ~ # tlmgr -repository /local/mirror/tlnet install collection-xetex

   ~ # tlmgr show collection-latexextra
   ```

# Additional Packages and Fonts

[Additional new or updated](http://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.html#x1-360003.4.6) packages and fonts are expected to be in TEXMFLOCAL (system-wide) or TEXMFHOME (per-user, RECOMMENDED), independent of TeX distributions.

For changes under TEXMFLOCAL, we should [update the search path for Kpathsea](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/476537), as TEXMFLOCAL is prefixed with double `!!`in _texmf.cnf_.

```
~ # mktexlsr [/usr/local/telive/texmf-local/]
# -or-
~ # mktexlsr [$(kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL)]

~ # kpsewhich foobar.sty
```

1. _mktexls_ acutally just creates a file named _ls-R_ under the specified directory.

   Without the directory argument, _mktexlsr_ tries updates all _ls-R_ for the installation.
2. You can also use *texhash* as it is just a symlink to _mktexlsr_.
