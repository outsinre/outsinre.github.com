title: Migrate Docker Desktop to colima
---

As required by the company, we have to remove Docker Desktop from our macOS. After searching over the web, I found the [colima - container runtime](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) a good alternative.


*CoLiMa* stands for "Container" on "Linux" or on "macOS". To [put it simple](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md), it replaces the Virtual Machine of Docker Desktop.

# Uninstall Docker Desktop #

Docker Desktop includes both the Docker CLI and Docker engine. After uninstallation, both components are removed, including images, containers, volumes, networks, etc.

See <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/uninstall/>.

# Install colima #

```bash
~ $ 
```

# Install Docker #
