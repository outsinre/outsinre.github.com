How to mount iOS and transfer files to Iphone?

1. Installation

   ```
   # echo "gnome-base/gvfs ios fuse" >> /etc/portage/package.use/gvfs, *fuse* is optional
   # emerge -av1 gvfs
   # emerge -avt usbmuxd
   # usbmuxd -f -v (opt), automatically invoked when iOS device plugged in
   ```

2. Restart X and login as a normal user account.
3. Thunar will remind you to [unlock passcode NO.31](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1861617&page=4&p=11531339#post11531339) in Iphone. Iphone might ask you to trust the computer. Just do it.
4. If you [cannot find](https://askubuntu.com/a/447416) *Documents on XXX's iPhone* in Thunar, restart iPhone.
5. If *fuse* USE is enabled, documents can be accessed under */var/run/user/1000/gvfs/* or *$HOME/.gvfs/*.
