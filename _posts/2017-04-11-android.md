# [TWRP](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=profile&uid=24686681827312830)

1. Operation of TWRP can be achieved by adb shell *twrp* command.
2. Set `rm -rf` to avoid re-formating EXT4 filesystem unpon wiping.
3. Mount as many partitions as possible.
4. Error. If you receive error like:

   ```
   Unable to mount /data
   ```

   Resort to:

   1. Adanced Wipe, Repair or Change File System;
   2. bootloader emergency recovery wipe;
   3. adb sideload.
5. After flashing TWRP, you can install a TWRP app which makes life easier.

# Tips

1. If previous ROM is official Android 6.0 and new ROM is 3rd party Android 7.0/7.1, you'd better firstly flash an official 7.0/7.1 development version (a big so-called "底包").
2. To support F2FS:
   1. 3rd party recovery (i.e. TWRP) should support creating F2FS filesystem (formating *data* and *cache* partitions). Don't format *system* partition as F2FS.

       Formatting *data* partition to F2FS would wipe the *internal storage* too.
   2. ROM can run on F2FS systems.

# [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html) (adb)

Android Debug Bridge (adb) is a versatile command-line tool that lets you communicate with a device (an *emulator* or a connected Android device).

The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device.

It is a client-server program that includes three components:

1. A client, which sends commands. The client runs on your development machine. You can invoke a client from a command-line terminal by issuing an adb command.
2. A daemon (adbd), which runs commands on an Android device. The daemon runs as a background process on each device.
3. A server, which manages communication between the client and the daemon. The server runs as a background process on your development machine.

## Installation

From Gentoo portage:

```bash
~ # emerge -avt dev-util/android-tools
# Android platform tools (adb, fastboot, and mkbootimg)
# Logout and login back to take effect
```

Current stable is 1.0.32. For an up-to-date version (recommended), [download here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html), which is a *standalone* version ready for local execution (just extract the zip):

```bash
~ $ cd ~/opt
~ $ unzip ~/Downloads/platform-tools-latest-linux.zip
~ $ ./adb -h
```

## Connection to device

There are two ways to pair an Android device with your PC, namely over USB cable and over Wi-Fi.

In order to let computer recognizes the Android device, we should enable [Developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html) and subsequent USB debugging.

Connect your device to PC with USB cable and:

### Over USB cable

```bash
~ $ ./adb start-server/kill-server
~ $ ./adb devices [-l]
~ $ ss/netstat -npelt
```

*adb devices* launches *adb start-server* on demand. When the server starts, it binds to local TCP port 5037 and listens for commands sent from adb clients - all adb clients use port 5037 to communicate with the adb server.

Example output:

```
List of devices attached
afc75758               device usb:1-1.2 product:NX531J model:NX531J device:NX531J
```

The serial number is *afc75758* while *device* represents connection state.

If *adb* prints:

```
List of devices attached
afc75758	unauthorized
```

Unlock your device and confirm PC RSA key (for first connection). This security mechanism protects user devices because it ensures that USB debugging and other adb commands cannot be executed unless you're able to unlock the device and acknowledge the dialog.

If *adb* complains:

```
List of devices attached
afc75758               no permissions (udev requires plugdev group membership); see [http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html] usb:1-1.2
```

Three methods available:

1. Run *adb* under *root* account.
2. Switch the USB connection type from *Charge only* to *Transmit files* (MTP) or *Transmit photos* (PTP) from device drop-down menu. Alternatively, set *Select USB configuration* in *Developer options*.
3. Follow the given link to create a **udev** rule your device:

   ```
   # lsusb
   Bus 001 Device 035: ID 19d2:abcd ZTE WCDMA Technologies MSM
   ```

   *lsub* prints the device vendor ID (19d2) and product ID (abcd). If */lib/udev/rules.d/69-libmtp.rules* (*media-libs/libmtp*) does NOT include your device, then

   ```
   # /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="19d2", ATTRS{idProduct}=="abcd", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0660", SYMLINK+="NX531J-%k"
   # or
   SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="19d2", ATTRS{idProduct}=="abcd", OWNER="jim", MODE="0600", SYMLINK+="NX531J-%k"
   ```

   Finally, *trigger* the rules:

   ```bash
   ~ # gpasswd -a username plugdev (optional)
   ~ # udevadm control -R/--reload (optional)
   ~ # udevadm trigger
   ```

   Pay attention to how GROUP and OWNER relates to MODE.
4. No matter what method you choose, it's recommended to:
   1. Kill current adb server: `./adb kill-server`.
   2. Revoke USB debugging authorizations in Developer options.
   3. Unplug USB cable and re-plug in back.

### Over Wi-Fi

Connection over Wi-Fi needs some initial setup over USB. Connect your Android device and adb host computer to a common Wi-Fi network accessible to both (i.e. WLAN).

```bash
~ $ ./adb tcpip 5555
~ $ ./adb connect device_ip_address
~ $ ./adb devices -l
```

>Connection over Wi-Fi is slow in speed and less secure subjecting to sniffer.

## adb commands

```bash
~ $ adb [-d | -e | -s serial_number] command
```

One of the most special is *shell*:

```bash
~ $ ./adb shell
# get into android Linux environment
shell@NX531J:/ $ ls /system/bin
shell@NX531J:/ $ netstat -lt
```

If you are connecting over Wi-Fi, *netstat* will show the TCP socket which is owned by *adb shell*. To tell the ADB daemon return to listening over USB and closing the socket:

```bash
~ $ ./adb usb
```

Other commands are *pull/push/backup* for file transmission and backup/restore. Pull/push is pretty fast to transmit files but may the device a hot potato - high temprature.

You should also pay attention to *remount/install/uninstall/shell* for file updating. Apart from traditional shell commands, there are two special ones, namely **am** (activity manager) and **pm** (package manager).

# Flashing

## fastboot TWRP

I will show how fastboot flashes TWRP.img to replace stock recovery. To make fastboot recognize your device,

1. Let the device get into fastboot mode.

   ```bash
   ~ $ ./adb reboot bootloader
   ```

   Another way is to use combination keys mostly by pressing power key and volume down key simultaneously. Details refer to your device documentation.
2. Create a udev rule.

   When the device is at fastboot mode, the product ID changes accordingly. We should add another udev rule like for adb.
3. Unplug and re-plug in the device.

```bash
~ $ ./fastboot devices -l
~ $ ./fastboot flash recovery /path/to/TWRP.img
```

That's all!

## [adb sideload](https://twrp.me/faq/ADBSideload.html) ROM

>The so-called "线刷" (over USB cable or Wi-Fi) connection without copying zip ROM.

As of version 2.3, TWRP now supports ADB sideload mode. ADB sideload is a different ADB mode that you can use to push and install a zip using one command from your computer.

There is no longer need to copy the zip ROM to USB or SD card anymore.

1. Let your device be in sideload. You either do it in TWRP menu or by adb command line from your computer:

   ```bash
   ~ $ ./adb reboot sideload/sideload-auto-reboot
   ~ $ ./adb devices
   ```

   You will get:

   ```
   List of devices attached
   afc75758	sideload
   ```

2. Flash the zip ROM

   ```bash
   ~ $ ./adb sideload /path/to/rom.zip
   ```

# ROM custiomization

Before flashing official zip ROM, delete builit-in promotional APKs to save storage. Alternatively, you have to delete them by *root* apps after flashing. Delete especially *recovery.img* and *recovery/*, otherwise it would replace TWRP.

>This process is actuallly making your own "底包".

Fine tuning after flashing. You may aslo want to do it under *reboot recovery* mode and mount *system* as read/write.

1. To add back a previously deleted app, *push* both the apk and *odex*. *install* does NOT help in case of apk with separate *odex*.

   ```bash
   ~ $ ./adb remount
   ~ $ ./adb push example.apk example.odex /system/app/
   ```

   You MUST **remount** before *push*ing to */system/app*.
2. To further delete a built-in apk,

   ```bash
   ~ $ ./adb remount
   ~ $ ./adb shell
   shell@NX531J:/ $ ls /system/app/
   shell@NX531J:/ $ rm -r /system/app/example/
   ```

3. You could use shell **pm** *install/uninstall* if you have *root* access.
