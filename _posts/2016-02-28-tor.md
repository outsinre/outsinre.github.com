title: Tor - Anonymity Online
---

# ABCs

1. Tor - the onion router - mainly devotes to hide your Internet identity.
2. Tor prevents people from learning your location or browsing habits.
3. Tor is for web browsers, instant messaging clients, and more.

# How

1. Tor perodically chooes different encryption routing relays. Your Tor IP is the exit relay's IP.

   Tor relay/node is usually free and built to route Tor traffic.
2. Tor traffic is NOT encrypted between *exit relay* and destination host.
3. Tor needs a centralized *directory host* to receve a list of *relay* relays.
4. Tor is blocked by GFW:
   1. Block the *directory* host;
   2. Block the *handshake* process;
   3. Block intermediate relys.
   4. Malicious relays.
5. Add a frontend proxy (Lantern for instance) to Tor. Frontend proxy bypasses GFW while Tor hide your Internet track.

   In this post, I use *ss* (also a SOCKS5) as the frontend proxy.
6. Use Tor not only to surf the Internet, but for other applications that support SOCKS5.

# Installation

```bash
# emerge net-misc/tor
# rc-service tor start
# rc-update add tor default
```

# Configuration - */etc/tor/torrc*

Refer to */etc/tor/torrc.sample* and `man tor`.

1. Basics

   ```
   User tor
   PIDFile /var/run/tor/tor.pid
   Log notice syslog
   DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/data
   ```

2. Frontend proxy

   Tor is blocked by GFW. We add a frontend proxy to Tor bypassing GFW. This proxy server will be inserted between *localhost* and Tor *entry relay*.

   This post uses *ss* - a SOCKS5 proxy.

   ```
   Socks5Proxy 127.0.0.1:1080
   ```

   Application -> Tor -> frontend proxy -> entry relay -> intermediate rely -> exit relay -> destination host. Traffic between application and exit relay is encrypted. Localhost IP is plain between application and frontend proxy.

   Though frontend proxy knows your IP but the traffic is encrypted! Exit relays and destination host know your traffic but does not know your real IP. What's more, if you visit destination host by *https*, then exit relay only knows encrypted *https* traffic.

   Bingo!
3. Stream isolation

   Isolate different applications by Tor port. By default, Tor service listens on *9050* port for all traffic. We can open more Tor ports for different applications.

   For example, web browser and instant messanger should better connect to Tor ports.

   ```
   # web browser
   SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9050
   # gpg client
   SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9100
   # instant messenger
   SocksPort 127.0.0.1:9150
   ```

4. ExcludeNodes

   Tor relies on routing *relay*. There are also malicious relays set by attacker/countries to analyze Tor traffic.

   Tell Tor not to use those relays:

   ```
   ExcludeNodes {cn},{hk},{mo}
   strictnodes 1
   ```

   Others are `kp ir sy pk cu vn`.
5. TorDNS

   Though *Tor + frontend proxy* is secure enough to hide your surfing track, DNS server still knows where you connect. So we further hide the DNS resolving process.

   *ATTENTION*: even you choose not to use Tor surfing the Internet, you can always use TorDNS resolver.

   1. To use TorDNS resolver:

      ```
      DNSPort 9053
      DNSListenAddress 127.0.0.1
      AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
      AutomapHostsSuffixes .exit,.onion
      ```

   2. Set TorDNS sever

      ```
      # /etc/resolv.conf
      nameserver 127.0.0.1
      ```

   3. Redirect DNS request to Tor port 9053.

       Redirect ALL DNS request on system from port 53 to 127.0.0.1:9053 where TorDNS listen for requests. Redirected to the local (torified) nameserver any DNS connection left.

      ```bash
      # iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p TCP --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:9053
      # iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p UDP --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:9053
      ```

   4. Disable Dhcpcd's *resolve.conf* hook, otherwise it will override */etc/resolv.conf* file on startup.

      ```
      # /etc/dhcpcd.conf
      nohook resolv.conf
      ```
      
   5. *tor-resolve* - TorDNS's command line tool.

      ```bash
      $ tor-resolve www.baidu.com
      ```

6. [optional] Transparent proxy

   Some applications that does not support proxy or Tor. Don't worry! Tor offers *transparent proxy* service to those applications with the help of *torify* command by forcing their traffic through Tor.

   Transparent proxy is NOT Tor's default SOCKS5 proxy! It achieves proxy utility by Linux kernel's *netfilter* functionality.

   1. Enable transparent proxy

      ```
      TransPort 9040
      TransListenAddress 127.0.0.1
      ```

   2. *torsocks* package

      ```bash
      # emerge -av net-proxy/torsocks
      ```

   3. Redirect non-Tor traffic to transparent proxy

      ```bash
      # iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p TCP -m owner ! --uid-owner tor -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:9040
      ```

   4. Test

      ```bash
      $ torify wget -qO- https://check.torproject.org/
      ```

      Force *wget* traffic through *transparent proxy*.
   5. If does work, check if some kernel options need 'Y' / 'M'.

6. [optional] Disable non-Tor traffic

   Do NOT do this unless *transparent proxy* is configured correctly. Otherwise, all non-Tor traffic cannot get out of box.

   1. Enable `NETFILTER_ADVANCED` and `XT_MATCH_OWNER` kernel option first.

      ```
      advanced netfiler configuration netfilter_advanced
	 <*>   "owner" match support xt_match_owner
      ```

   2. *to-do*.

7. Restart Tor service

   ```
   rc-service tor restart
   ```

# Firefox setting

1. The main usage of Tor resides in *WWW surfing*. First make sure *foxproxy* extension is installed.

   I have configured *foxproxy* for *ss* previously.
2. In *foxproxy*, *Add New Proxy*.

   ```
   Proxy Name: tor-ss
     Perform remote DNS lookups on hostnames ...

   Host or IP Address: 127.0.0.1 Port: 9050
   SOCKS proxy SOCKS v5
   ```

   1. Remember to place the Tor proxy at the beggining of proxy list - highest proxy priority!
   2. Now Firefox has two proxies to choose from.
   3. Tick *Perform remote DNS lookups ...*
3. about:config

   ```
   network.proxy.socks_remote_dns    true
   network.dns.disablePrefetch       true
   network.dns.disableIPv6           true
   ```

   This way Firefox will resolve host names via Tor proxy DNS resolver (i.e. *ss* also support DNS resolving. Talked laster), which prevents DNS leaks.

   The first item is the key to use TorDNS.

# Usage

## Prerequisite

1. As we add a frontend proxy to Tor, it should launch before Tor working.
2. All DNS lookups on system are through Tor. If application failed to resolve hostnames, check if Tor is running.
   
## Applications.

Any applications that support SOCKS5 proxy can make use of Tor service.

In its proxy setting, fill *socks5* server to *127.0.0.1* and *port* to one of the *stream isolation* port number.

For those do NOT support proxy or Tor, refer to *transparent proxy* above.
## Firefox

Up to now, Firefox has two SOCKS5 proxy servers Tor and *ss* to choose from. You can choose either one or both simultaneously through *foxproxy* extension.

1. *ss* for all URLs

   Use *ss* proxy surfing the Internet.
2. Tor alone

   Use Tor surfing the Internet. However, Tor is blocked by GFW making this method infeasible.
3. Simutaneously

   That's how Tor is commonly used: support from frontend proxy. Recall that we add *SocksProxy* in Tor's configuration to enable *ss* frontend proxy.

   When choosing *tor for all URLs* in *foxproxy*, Firefox actually use Tor + *ss* concurrently.
4. Of course, we can choose *use proxies based on their pre-defined patterns and priorities* in *foxproxy*.

## DNS resolving

As discussed above, the system is configured to use TorDNS resolver preventing DNS lookup leaks. All DNS requests are *redirecting* to TorDNS by *iptables*.

Try to `rc-service tor stop`, then the system cannot resolve DNS anymore as TorDNS is down!

# Tips

1. Don't use Tor to sign in Email/forum. The purpose of Tor is hiding traffic tack. Email, forum etc systems can analyze your traffic. No matter which method you use for connection, final interaction with sign in system is plain text.
2. 关于深网

   深网用户通过特殊的技术手段隐匿用户信息（如IP地址等）登陆“深网”以后，就能完全脱离世间法律或NSA（美国国家安全局）等政府管制力量的钳制和监管，在那里，你可以通过网站肆意的购买枪支弹药，可以发布悬赏杀人的告示，可以购买冰毒和可卡因，可以随意浏览儿童色情网站，也可以办理各种假证伪造身份。仅有4%的网络数据是可以通过搜索引擎找到的，其他的都深藏在“深网”中。

   96%的网络数据都是无法用使用搜索引擎查找的，但这些网站的服务器实体可能分布在互联网管制薄弱的东欧国家，背后由深谙网络安全技术的黑客维护，多以.onion作为域名，采用特殊的加密机制，不能通过搜索引擎查找，即使知道域名也无法采用传统的HTTP方式直接访问，必须采用特殊手段才能接入，就好像只有游吟诗人维吉尔的引领，但丁才可以窥见Limbo里的曲径通幽处。

   而今天我们这个引路人就是Tor（The Onion Router），直译过来为“洋葱路由”。既然已经通过 Tor 打开了“深网”的大门，那么让我们就将其一窥究竟，因为广大的深网网站都无法被搜索引擎收录，所以我们必须要找到一个收录各类深网网站的索引站点，“Hidden Wiki”就是其中较为出名的一个，它收录了各类深网网站地址。
