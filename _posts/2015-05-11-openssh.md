# Overview

Secure Shell, or SSH, is a cryptographic (encrypted) network *protocol* to allow remote *login* and *other network services* to operate securely over an unsecured network.

In the old ages, *telnet* protocol traffic is plain text subject to interception. Now services on SSH can be encrypted by different ciphers (i.e. RSA, DSA etc.). In addition to *remote login*, other services can reside on SSH protocol like content transfer.

*protocol* (i.e. SSH) is different from *implementation* (OpenSSH) or *command* (i.e. *ssh*, *scp* etc.). OpenSSH gives tool set like *ssh*, *scp*, *sftp*, *ssh-keygen* etc.

# Goal

In this post, I will setup remote login with Public-key infrastructure to achieve passwordless connection.

1. local host
2. remote host
3. *ssh* from local host to remote host with key pair.

# Generate Public-key pair

The core of Public-key infrastructure is creating personal public and private key pair. The public key literally is distributed *publicly* over the Internet, while the private key is *privately* kept by yourself.

On local host that we connect from, run `ssh-keygen`:

```bash
~ $ ssh-keygen -l [ -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github.pub ]

~ $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 384 -o -C "zachary.hu@konghq.com (Kong Dev)" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_kh

~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -o -C "email@example.com (openssh-rsa-4096)" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:abcdedajfajqiefafanfaqrnafafaf8rqhfafdafjajfafeaqn rsa-keys
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|        .+o+o.+==|
|       oE.o..q..=|
|      . o=o......|
|     + o.=o..s. .|
|    . + S . .... |
|     . + . ..q.  |
|    . . +    .   |
|   o ..+     w   |
|  .o==+ +        |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

1. Do NOT use "ssh-dss" (DSA) public key algorithm. Refer to [openssh legacy](http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html). The default algorithm is *rsa* such that `-t rsa` may be omitted..
2. *~/.ssh/id_rsa* is the private key (also termed as *identity* in SSH); *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub* is the public key to be shared over the Internet.
3. It prompts for *passphrase* to encrypt private key *locally*. If someone steal the private key file, he cannot impersonate you to communicate on the Internet. You are encouraged to set a passphrase.

   You can just press ENTER key to not use passphrase - empty passphrase to achieve *passwordless*. This does make a difference when connecting to remote host. Details refer below.

   It can be changed afterwards by `-p -f` argument.
4. The default key size is 2048 which is subject to modernized brute force break. Use 4096!
5. The CLI option `-o` is deprecated. Read [What does ssh-keygen "-o" do?](https://superuser.com/q/1455735/221946).

# Distribute the public key

Now share the public key file *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub* over the Internet to remote host. If we lost hte public key, we can restore it from the private key:

```bash
~ $ ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

*append* the public key to *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* on remote host.

*authorized_keys* is a file that stores SSH public keys. Each time a new publick-key pair is generated, append the new public key to it. To accomplish this, run `ssh-copy-id`:

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10
```

Alternatively, we can use:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat - >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

1. *192.168.0.10* can also be the domain name of remote host.
2. Both ways achieve the same purpose: append the public key to *authorized_keys* file. `ssh-copy-id` automatically creates *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* if it does not exist.
3. Pay attention to `-p` argument of `mkdir`: make parent directories as needed, no error if existing.

No matter which command you chose, you should see something like:

```
The authenticity of host '[192.168.0.10]:22 ([192.168.0.10]:22)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:afjaijfjfajeiqrityqpqvnbvlaeafjadfj.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
uname@192.168.0.10's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '22' 'uname@192.168.0.10'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

1. SSH with Public-key has not been configured yet. So you are required to provide the remote host *uname* password.
2. SSH into remote host to make sure *authorized_keys* permission is *600*.

    *ssh-copy-id* can handle permissions automatically while the alternative method might not.
3. It is *distribute/copy*, NOT *cut from local host*. That means the public key should be kept locally.

# ssh

By default, sshd on remote server accepts both key-based or password-based connection. The key method is superior to password method.

```bash
~$ ssh -p 22 uname@192.168.0.10

Enter passphrase for key '/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa': 
Last login: Thu Dec  3 07:59:14 2015 from 122.205.7.55
```

From the output, `ssh` prompts you to input *passphrase* of public-key files. Recall that we have set a passphrase when generating public-key pair to encrypt public-key files on local host.

If you leave the passphrase empty at setup, *ssh* will login immediately without any interaction - *passwordless* login. However, such login lose security of public-key files themselves.

On [macOS](2020/10/12/macos.md), the Terminal app would *set locale environment variables on startup* when SSH to a remote server. This would [disrupt remote locale](https://sskaje.me/2014/01/lc-ctype-issue/). Therefore, either disable that option in Terminal settings or customize remote server's *locale* setting. For example [CentOS](2017/04/05/centos/rhel.md), check */etc/locale.conf*.

# Passwordless

A better way on local host is to:

1. Use passphrase to encrypt key pair.
2. Use *ssh-agent* to unlock and cache private key.

The little program *ssh-agent* does you a favor by managing your keys for you. You enter the passphrase once, and after that, *ssh-agent* keeps your key cached in its memory and pulls it up whenever it is asked for it *during current X/shell session*.

To use the agent first create one. Just enter `eval $(ssh-agent -s)` and thats all. This will put you in a bash shell with two important environment variables `SSH_AGENT_PID` (agent process ID) and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (agent socket location on system) exported. `ssh-agent -s` alone does **not** export the two variables automatically, which applies to `ssh-agent -k` etc. as well.

Append:

```bash
# Start the ssh-agent if not already running
if ! pgrep -x -u "${USER}" ssh-agent >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    eval $(/usr/bin/gpg-agent -s)
fi
```

to *~/.bashrc*.

After that you should add your key (file) by *ssh-add*. Without arguments, it adds the standard *identity* *~/.ssh/id_rsa*, *~/.ssh/id_dsa*, *~/.ssh/id_ecdsa*, *~/.ssh/id_ed25519* and *~/.ssh/identity* (SSHv1). To add an identity deviant from standard location or name, run `ssh-add /location/of/key`. *ssh-add* will ask for *passphrase*. After that the key is loaded into the key manager *ssh-agent* for the whole X/shell session.

1. Check if any agents exist on system: `ps -ef | grep -i ssh-agent`.

    *ssh-agent* is usually started at the beginning of the X session, or from a shell startup script like "~/.bash_profile". It works by creating a unix-socket, and registering the appropriate environment variables so that all subsequent applications can take advantage of its services by connecting to that socket. Clearly, it only makes sense to start it in the parent process of an X session to use the set of decrypted private keys in all subsequent X applications.

    On my Gentoo system, "startx" will help launch *ssh-agent* automatically.
2. `printenv | grep -i ssh`, check whether `SSH_AGENT_PID` (agent process ID) and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (agent socket location on system) are exported to current X/shell environment. All subsequent applications depend on these two variables to make use of *ssh agent* on system.
3. Current agent

    **Agents found on system does NOT guarantee those two variables exported**. For example, a sever shared among multiple users has many agents running which might be created by some of the users. Now you login for an X/shell session. That very session (applications thereof) does NOT know anything about existing agents on system since `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` are not set to one of the agents.

    The current agent means the agent to which `SSH_AGENT_PID` and `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` are pointed. To switch to another agent, set the two variables to the new agent's process ID and socket path.
4. Example of adding key to agent.

   ```
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   Enter passphrase for /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa: 
   Identity added: /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa)
   ```

   Type your passhrase. Now, you should NOT be prompted for a password whenever you use ssh, scp, or sftp etc. commands.
5. Limit: *ssh-add* does NOT persist across reboot/shutdown/logout due to loss of *ssh agents* or *the two variables*. So usuallly the *passwordless* login only lasts for the *current agent*.

   Each time of login and SSH connection, run *ssh-add* once to achieve passwordless login. For a server, this is fine. But on personal laptop/PC that require shutdown frequently, it is tedious/annoying to run `ssh-add`.

   This is a trade-off between security and utility. If you want *passwordless* forever, resort to *keychain*.
6. Reuse existing agents.

   For example, on my Gentoo, *ssh-agent* started with `startx` XFCE4 DE is attached to that specific X session (Xfce4-terminal emulator included). If I don't launch `startx` or switch to another virtual terminal (Ctrl+Alt+F2) and login, this login shell does not either start *ssh-agent* or know the agent already launched!

   We can launch *ssh-agent* in shell's configuration script (*.bashrc*, *.bash_profile*, *.xinitrc* etc.). Add ``eval `ssh-agent -s` > /dev/null`` and `ssh-add` to *.xinitrc* (mainly for X), *bash_profile* (mainly for login shell and subsequent interactive shell), and *.bashrc* (mainly for interactive shell).

   At the end of *.bash_profile*, *.bashrc* is sourced. If you want to execute a shell script *only once* for the whole login, add to *.bash_profile* instead of *.bashrc* (would be executed each time a new terminal emulator launched).

   However, adding *ssh-agent* and *ssh-add* to shell's configuration script will always launch an new agent on every login. We only need SSH on demand! So the basic idea is to:

   1. let new X/shell reuse eixsting agents.
   2. If there is not any agents, create one.

# ssh-find-agent

ssh-find-agent is a tool:
 
1. locating existing ssh compatible agent sockets (e.g., ssh-agent, gpg-agent, gnome-keyring, osx-keychain).
2. prompt to create one if no agents found.
3. optionally (invoked with `-a` or `-c`), sets `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variables accordingly.
   1. and set temporal ssh alias

For lastest update, check GitHub.

# SSH config

1. `man ssh_config`. The client side config file */etc/ssh/ssh_config* or *~/.ssh/config*. Local host - the host that connect from.

   *ssh* command supports a variety of different parameters. For example, in order to restrict malicious attempt, you are recommended to change default port number. Other parameters are remote host IP etc. difficult and tedious to remember and input.

   There's a much more elegant and flexible solution - put those arguments in *~/.ssh/config*. The configuration files contain sections separated by “Host” specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that match one of the patterns given in the specification.

   Each host section defines a *host alias*. When connecting, just `ssh host-alias`. *ssh* will look up alias from config file and choose the first matched to connect to.

   The first obtained value for each parameter is used, more host-specific declarations should be given near the beginning of the file, and general defaults at the end. Values at the beginning are superior to those afterwards. The order of privilege:

   ```
   1. command-line options
   2. user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
   3. system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
   ```
   
   Here is an example:

   ```
   # ~/.ssh/config
   Host vps
        HostName 192.168.0.10
        Port 1025
        User bob
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vps_rsa_key
   Host github-project1
       User git
       HostName github.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.project1.key
   Host github-org
       User git
       HostName github.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.org.key
   Host github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github.key
   Host tunnel
       HostName database.example.com
       User coolio
       LocalForward 9906 127.0.0.1:3306
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/coolio.example.key
   ```
   
   From the example, different keys are set for different *github.com* projects.

   The "LocalForward" is interesting! 9906 (or 127.0.0.1:9906) is local port and xx.xx.xx.xx:3306 is a remote host port. SSH will establish a tunnel in between 127.0.0.1:9906 and xx.xx.xx.xx:3306 through the intermediate HostName. For example, the target host xx.xx.xx.xx only accepts connection to port 3306 locally. This example is special case for database operations. The target host is the same as HostName. Actually, it can even be "www.youtube.com:443"

   To create the tunnel, just run `ssh -qfCNT tunnel`:
   
   1. `-q` causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.
   2. `-f` force *ssh* to background just before command execution but after password authentication.
   3. `-C` compresses all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and UNIX-domain connections). Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks.
   4. `-N` does not execute a remote command.
   5. `-T` disable pseudo-terminal allocation. As database does not require pseduo-terminal.

   The options are useful for *forwarding ports* and *dynamic application-layer tunnel* (need extra `-D` parameter). We cans specify these options on a per-host basis in configuration file (refer to `-o` of `man ssh`).

   In addition to *LocalForward*, there is also *RemoteRorward*. No matter of *local* or *remote* forward, VPS should have a public IP while the *LocalForward* or *RemoteForward* host (NOT the vps - *uname@remote-host*) usually don't have public IP or are blocked from each other.

   For instance, two host A and C are separated by their NAT networks. Host B are on the Internet with public IP which is accessible by A and B but not the reverse! How to achieve A and C's communication by SSH? Use *remoteforward*! A establishes remote forward to B. After that C connection to B will be forwarded to A.

   Aside, there is another port forwarding - *dynamic port forwarding* (details below).

   Refer to [SSH 隧道与端口转发（v2ex 首发）](https://www.v2ex.com/t/127124).
2. *scp* can also make use of the config file.

   ```bash
   ~ $ scp bandwagon:~/Document/file.txt .
   ~ $ scp ~/Document/video.mp4 bandwagon:/Downloads
   ```
   
3. `man sshd_config`. The server side config file */etc/ssh/sshd_config*. Remote host - the host that connect to.

   You can disable account password login by *PasswordAuthentication no*. Then remote host can only be accessed by public-key pair. Be careful, if you lost the key pair, you probably could no longer login.

   You can also put *~/.ssh/authorized_keys* somewhere, and set *AuthorsizedKeysFile /path/to/authorized_keys*.

# SSH tunnel

We can use SSH tunnel to bypass GFW.

```bash
$ ssh -qfNT -D 127.0.0.1:12345 user@vps.ip
```

On slow network connections, try `-C` to compress data. However, `-C` will downgrade connection on fast network.

# Make it simple

1. By ssh-find-agent:
   1. ssh-find-agent
   2. ssh
2. What we have:
   1. eval `` `ssh-agent -s` ``
   2. ssh-add
   3. ssh

# Backup

Different from Gnupg key's binary format, OpenSSH key (*~/.ssh/id_rsa* and *~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub*) is stored in *armor* format. To backup the key, just copying the private key.

Public key can be easily generated from private key by `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -y > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

# Change passphrase

```bash
~ $ ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
