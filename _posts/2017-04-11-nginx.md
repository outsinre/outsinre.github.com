# Nginx Installation #

```bash
~ # dnf install nginx
~ # systemctl enable nginx
~ # systemctl status nginx
```

# Nginx Overview #

1. [Starter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)
2. Nginx has one master process and several worker processes.
   1. The main purpose of master process is to read and evaluate configurations, maintain worker processes, manage TCP connections etc.
   2. Worker process respond to client requests. The number of worker processes is subject to the number of CPU cores, the storage size of HDDs, load pattern etc.
3. Nginx employs event-based model and OS-dependent mechanisms to efficiently distribute requests among worker processes.
4. By default, the configuration file is located within  */etc/nginx/nginx.conf*.

# Have a Try #

Firstly, edit, test and reload the configuration:

```bash
~ # nginx -t

~ # nginx -s reload
# -or-
~ # systemctl reload nginx
```

Then start Nginx:

```bash
~ # systemctl start nginx
~ # pe -eF | fgrep -i nginx
```

To terminate Nginx:

```bash
~ # nginx -s quit/stop
# -or-
~ # systemctl quit/stop nginx
```

The *quit* signal is a graceful method to shutdown the service, waiting for worker processes to finish ongoing requests before stopping all nginx processes.

# Nginx Context #

A Simple Directive consists of a *name* and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;).

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN ;

A Block Directive has the same structure as a simple directive. But the ending semicolon is substituted with a set of additional _instruction_s surrounded by braces ('{' and '}'), like *map*.

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN { instructions }

If a Block Directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a Context, like _events_, _http_, _server_, and _location_. The _location_ context is what we encounter daily.

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN { directives; }

Contexts can be nested. For example, the _event_ and _http_ directives reside in the _main_ context, _server_ in _http_ and _location_ in _server_. The _main_ context is the outmost context. Nginx does not name the _main_.

Directives outside of any contexts are considered to be in the _main_ context.

```
# main context

directive1;

event {
    directive2;
    directive3;
}

http {
    directive4;

    map $http_upgrade $connection_header {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
    }

    server {
        directive5;

        location [ = | ~ | ~* | ^~ ] uri {
            directive6;
            directive7;
        }
        
        directive8;
    }

    directive9;
}
```

# Rule of thumb #

>Do not Repeat Yourself.

1. Set directives at their broadest applicable context.
2. Modular configuration. Different configuration files or directories can be integrated into _nginx.conf_ by the _include_ directive.
   1. sites-available;
   2. sites-enabled;
   3. default.d
   4. modules.d
   5. conf.d

# Request Processing #

Firstly, nginx determines which _server_ context should serve a request.

1. It tests the IP and port of the _listen_ directive.

   If the the request is received at the specified IP and/or port, the _server_ context is selected as a candidate.
2. For each selected candidate, Nginx tests the '$host' variable against the *server_name* directive and select the matched _server_ context.
3. If none of the candidates match, then choose the *default server* context.

   There is a special directive called `default_server` that is a property of the *port* part of _listen_ directive, NOT that of *server_name* directive. Therefore, different `default_server` can be configured for different ports. Check whatever!

## Location Match  ##

Once a server context is determined, a location should be chosen as well. Nginx tests the *request line* without query arguments, namely the [uri](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48709976) part.

A general _location_ context is as `location optional_modifier uri { }`. The *optional_modifier* can be one of `= | ~ | ~* | ^~`. If none of the modifiers are provided, it is called _prefix_ match.

1. `=` means *exact* match.
2. `~` (case-sensitive) and `~*` (case-insensitive) do *regex* match.
3. `^~` is a special *prefix* match. If the relevant *uri* has the *longest prefix*, regex match is omited. Hence, we call it *not regex* match.

The match order is as the following:

1. Firstly, do `=` match. If matched, terminate the search.
2. Secondly, do *prefix* match that searches the *longest prefix*, irrespective of _location_ order.
   1. If the longest match has modifier `^~`, then terminate the search.
   2. Otherwise, the longest match is kept as a candidate.
3. Thirdly, do regex in the order of their appearance in the configuration file.
   1. The first matched regex terminates the search.
   2. If none of the regexn is matched, then the longest prefix match in 2.2 is selected.

# Multiple Conditions #

```
if ($request_uri = /) {
  set $con root;
}

if ($host ~* example.com) {
  set $con "${con}+example.com";
}

if ($http_cookie !~* "auth_token") {
  set $con "${con}+no_auth_token";
}

if ($con = "root+example.com+no_auth_token") {
  return 403;
}
```
# Concurrent Connections #

By default, a single worker process allows 1024 connections simutaneously. We can litmit the number by:

```
events {
    worker_connections 50;
}
```

# Catch-all Virtual Server #

```
# catch-all 'default_server' vhosts

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name _;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

    location / {
	    # Use "$host" instead of "$server_name" unless you have special needs.
        #return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    error_page 404 /40x.html;
    location = /40x.html {
        internal;
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        internal;
    }
}

# Settings for a TLS enabled server.

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;

    server_name _;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Let's Encrypt will start offer wildcard certs beginning 2018
    ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

    location / {
        return 404;
    }

    error_page 404 /40x.html;
    location = /40x.html {
        internal;
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        internal;
    }

}
```

1. All HTTP requests are redirected (301) to HTTPS.
2. Trigger 404 code, telling end users that the request is not expected.
3. Attention to `server_name: _;`
