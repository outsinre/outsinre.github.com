# Installation

```bash
~ # yum install nginx
~ # systemctl enable nginx
~ # systemctl start nginx
```

# Structure

1. [Starter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)
2. nginx has one master process and several worker processes.
   1. The main purpose of master process is to read and evaluate configuration, and maintain worker processes.
   2. Worker process respond to client requests.
3. nginx employs event-based model and OS-dependent mechanisms to efficiently distribute requests among worker processes.
4. By default, the configuration file is named *nginx.conf* and placed in the directory */usr/local/nginx/conf*, */etc/nginx*, or */usr/local/etc/nginx*.
5. Directives: `main context {events context} {http context {server context {location context}}}`

# Configuration

Before reloading new modified configuration, check syntax:

```bash
~ # nginx -t
~ # nginx -s reload
# or
~ # systemctl reload nginx
```

## Concurrent connections

By default, a single worker process allows 1024 connections simutaneously. We can litmit the number by:

```
events {
    worker_connections 10;
}
```

## Limit connection rate

By `limit_req_zone`.
