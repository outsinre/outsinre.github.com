# Installation

```bash
~ # yum install nginx
~ # systemctl enable nginx
~ # systemctl start nginx
~ # pe -eF | fgrep -i nginx
```

# Structure

1. [Starter](https://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)
2. nginx has one master process and several worker processes.
   1. The main purpose of master process is to read and evaluate configuration, and maintain worker processes.
   2. Worker process respond to client requests. The number of worker processes includes (but not limited to) the number of CPU cores, the number of HDDs, and load pattern.
3. nginx employs event-based model and OS-dependent mechanisms to efficiently distribute requests among worker processes.
4. By default, the configuration file is named *nginx.conf*.

# Control

Before reloading new modified configuration, check syntax:

```bash
~ # nginx -t
~ # nginx -s reload
# or
~ # systemctl reload nginx
#
~ # nginx -s quit/stop
```

The *quit* signal is a graceful method to shutdown the service. It waits for worker processes to finish ongoing requests before stopping all nginx processes.

# .conf Structure

A Simple Directive consists of a *name* and parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;).

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN ;

A Block Directive has the same structure as a simple directive. But the ending semicolon is substituted with a set of additional _instruction_s surrounded by braces ('{' and '}').

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN { instructions }

If a Block Directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a Context (examples: _events_, _http_, _server_, and _location_), which is what we are encounted with daily.

>name arg1 arg2 ... argN { directives; }

Directives outside of any contexts are considered to be in the _main_ context. The _event_ and _http_ directives reside in the _main_ context, _server_ in _http_ and _location_ in _server_.

```
# main context

directive1;

event {
    directive2;
    directive3;
}

http {
    directive4;

    server {
        directive5;

        location [ = | ~ | ~* | ^~ ] uri {
            directive6;
            directive7;
        }
        
        directive8;
    }

    directive9;
}
```

# DRY

>Do not Repeat Yourself.

1. Set directives at their broadest applicable scope.
2. Modular configuration. Different configuration files or directories can be integrated into _nginx.conf_ by _include_ directiv.
   1. sites-available;
   2. sites-enabled;
   3. default.d
   4. modules.d

# Request Processing

Firstly, nginx determines which _server_ context should serve a request.

1. It tests the IP and port of the _listen_ directive.

   If the the request is received at the specified IP and/or port, the _server_ block is selected as a candidate.
2. For all the selected candidate, nginx tests the 'host' header against *server_name* parts and select the matched _server_ block.
3. If none of the _server_ blocks match, then choose the _server_ block with `default_server` parameter.

   `default_server` is a property of the *port* part of _listen_ directive, NOT that of *server_name* directive. Therefore, different `default_server` can be configured for different ports.

Then, nginx decides the _location_ directive to be used.

>location optional_modifier uri { }

1. [uri vs request_uri](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48709976). Basically, _uri_ is the original *request_uri*, removing arguments.
2. Nginx tests only a URI part of request line _without_ arguments ('$uri').
3. *optional_modifier* can be one of `= | ~ | ~* | ^~`. If none of the modifiers are provided, it is called _prefix_ match.
   1. `=` means *exact* match.
   2. `~` (case-sensitive) and `~*` (case-insensitive) do *regex* match.
   3. `^~` is special. If _uri_ is the longest prefix match, regex match is omited.

To choose _location_ matching a request, nginx:

1. Firstly, do `=` match. If matched, terminate the search.
2. Secondly, do prefix match that search the _longest_ match, irrespective of _location_ order.
   1. If the longest match has modifier `^~`, then terminate the search.
   2. Otherwise, the longest match is kept as a candidate.
3. Thirdly, do regex in the order of their appearance in the configuration file.
   1. The first matched regex terminates the search.
   2. If none of the regexs is matched, then the longest prefix match is selected.

# Directives

1. include

   Integrate other _.conf_ into _nginx.conf_.
2. listen
   1. *default_server* parameter.
   2. Accept a [UNIX-domain socket file](https://serverfault.com/a/124518).

# Concurrent connections

By default, a single worker process allows 1024 connections simutaneously. We can litmit the number by:

```
events {
    worker_connections 50;
}
```

# Dot file

```
# /etc/nginx/default.d/dotfile.conf

# '~': case-sensitive regular expression
location ~ /\.well-known/acme-challenge {
    allow all;
    default_type "text/plain";
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/.well-known/acme-challenge;
}

# '^~': prefix string superior to regular expression
# 'alias' VS 'root'.
location ^~ /.well-known/acme-challenge {
    allow all;
    default_type "text/plain";
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
}

# disable access to hidden files
# escape regular expression dot
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
}
```

1. Disable access to hidden files except that for ACME.
2. `~` means match by regular expression. Hence, dot should be escaped.
3. `^~` means plain string match that takes priority over regular expression.
4. *include* this in every *server* directive. For example,

   ```
   include /etc/nginx/default.d/dotfile.conf;
   ```

## Catch-all server directives

```
# catch-all 'default_server' vhosts

server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    server_name www.example.com blog.example.com test.example.com;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

    location / {
        # return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }

    error_page 404 /40x.html;
    location = /40x.html {
        internal;
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        internal;
    }
}

Use *host* instead of *server_name* unless you have special needs.

# Settings for a TLS enabled server.

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2 default_server;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2 default_server;

    server_name _;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # For catch-all vhost, LE will start offer wildcard certs beginning 2018
    # before that, share with other vhosts or get new one
    ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/test.example.com/fullchain.pem";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/test.example.com/privkey.pem";
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    # Load configuration files for the default server block.
    include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

    location / {
        return 404;
    }

    error_page 404 /40x.html;
    location = /40x.html {
        internal;
    }

    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        internal;
    }

}
```

1. All HTTP requests are redirected (301) to HTTPS.
2. Trigger 404 code.
3. Attention to `server_name: _;`
