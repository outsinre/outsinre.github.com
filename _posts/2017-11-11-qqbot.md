[QQBot](https://github.com/pandolia/qqbot) written with Python, is a conversation robot base on Tencent's SmartQQ. This post describes QQbot on Gentoo PC.

# Installation

```bash
# within virtualenv
~ $ pip install qqbot
~ $ qqbot -h
```

At the very first run, it may throw exception complaining lack of *sqlite3* module. Make sure *python* is built with relevant USE:

```bash
~ # echo 'dev-lang/python sqlite' >> /etc/portage/package.use/python
~ # emerge -av1 dev-lang/python:3.6
```

# Startup

## Help

Firstly, check basic parameters:

```bash
~ $ qqbot -h
```

Especially, pay attention to `--daemon --bench --qq`.

## First run

```bash
~ $ qqbot
# -or-
~ $ qqbot -q <qq number>
```

For the very first run, a QRcode pops up. Use QQ mobile app to scan for authorization. `-q` attempts to load login cookies locally first and resorts to QRcode if that fails.

In order that QRcode image pops up automatically, *gvfs-open* or *shotwell* must be available under Linux system, which should not be a problem as long as *gvfs* package is installed. We can, however, manually open the QRcode located under *~/.qqbot-tmp/\*.png*.

Once login, a QQbot-term service is launched at port 8188 for interaction. Open a new terminal and:

```bash
~ $ qq help
~ $ qq list [ buddy | group | discuss ]
~ $ qq list buddy [ name | nick | mark | qq ] = xxx
~ $ qq list buddy name:like:xxx
~ $ qq list group-member <qq group>
```

For more operations, refer to official README.MD section 3.

Aternatively, all operations can be done through HTTP API. For example, open *http://localhost:8188/list/buddy*. We just separate each argument by `/`. This is pretty useful when terminal output jumbers disorderly.

# Configuration

Check *~/.qqbot-tmp/v2.x.conf*, and add a section for specific QQ account:

```
    "jim" : {
        "termServerPort" : 8188,
        "qq" : "123456789",
        "daemon" : True,
	"plugins" : [],
	"pluginsConf" : {},
    },
```

1. If there are multiple QQ accounts, please assign different *termServerPort*.
2. *daemon* mode releases terminal immediately after login. *stout* and *stderr* are redirected to *daemon-$qq.log*.
3. *plugins* list overides the default value.

With that configuration block, launch QQbot by `-u`:

```bash
~ $ qq stop
~ $ qqbot -u jim
```

User configuration section name instead of QQ number after `-u`.

# Plugins

Pre-built plugins (i.e. *qqbot.plugins.sample* ) are installed into *site-packages/qqbot/plugins* reference to whom should be prefixed with *qqbot.plugins.*.

To be simple, put personal plugin *myplugin.py* under *~/.qqbot-tmp/plugins* directory. You can load a plugin on-the-fly (hot-plug way) or by telling QQbot to load it on startup. Reference to personal plugin is the script filename.

1. hot-plug method.

   ```bash
   ~ $ qq plugins (list loaded)
   ~ $ qq plug qqbot.plugins.test
   ~ $ qq plugins
   ~ $ qq unplug myplugin
   ```

2. Automatic plug

   Put your desired plugin name to `"plugins" : ['autohello',]` list.

# qqbot.plugins.miniirc

To be able to talk with IRC client:

```bash
~ $ qq plug qqbot.plugins.miniirc
```

Then launch Weechat:

```
/server add qqbot localhost/6667
# set qqbot nick; change sasl_mechanism to plain; turn off ssl and ssl_verify;
/connect qqbot
/list
/join #group
/query buddy-name
```

The *minirrc* plugin is limited and recognizes only QQ *name*. For instance, you cannot *query* a QQ number.
