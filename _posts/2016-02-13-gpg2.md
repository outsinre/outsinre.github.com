title: GnuPG 2
---

In the previous post SSH, I talked about *secure connection* (i.e. remote login) on the Internet. Now you will see how GnuPG (GPG) is used to *encrypt/decrypt* messages (i.e. email, documents).

# First run

If you never run *gpg*, then try `--list-keys` or `--fingerprint` (include fingerprint of key).

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ gpg --list-keys
gpg: directory `/home/jim/.gnupg' created
gpg: new configuration file `/home/jim/.gnupg/gpg.conf' created
gpg: WARNING: options in `/home/jim/.gnupg/gpg.conf' are not yet active during this run
gpg: keyring `/home/jim/.gnupg/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: /home/jim/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
```
This will try to list available GPG keys on system. The first time it's run, *gpg* will create some directories and files essential to the correct operation and implementation of GnuPG.

Read that post first before coming back here.

# Create key

The very first step of using GnuPG is *creating a key pair*.

Here is what I will do:

1. Choose default key method: (1) RSA and RSA (default).
2. Keysize - the longest - 4096 bits.
3. Key valid for one year
4. Provide name and email address to identify the key.
5. Provide a *passphrase* to protect the private key. The public key don't need protection.
6. Get the key ID: the hex string after the slash of the *pub* output: 12345678.
7. `gpg --list-keys` again to check results.

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ gpg --gen-key

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 1y
Key expires at Sun 12 Feb 2017 03:28:59 PM CST
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Jim WU
Email address: email@gmx.com
Comment: Gnus GPG Mail
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Jim WU (Gnus GPG Mail) <email@gmx.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? N
Real name: Jim Wu
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Jim Wu (Gnus GPG Mail) <email@gmx.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

gpg: key 12345678 marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.

gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
gpg: next trustdb check due at 2017-02-12
pub   4096R/12345678 2016-02-13 [expires: 2017-02-12]
      Key fingerprint = 0DE8 C833 06AB 8AC2 1980  0013 22B4 40A3 2976 6307
uid       [ultimate] Jim Wu (Gnus GPG Mail) <email@gmx.com>
sub   4096R/87654321 2016-02-13 [expires: 2017-02-12]
```
GnuPG will take several minutes to generate the key pair. You'd better moving the mouse, browsing the web, or having streaming audio in the background will help speed up the process.

# Revocation fallback

Create a revocation certificate fallback. Doing this allow you to revoke the key in case something nasty happens (think of a malicious user gaining control of the key).

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ gpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke 12345678

sec  4096R/12345678 2016-02-13 Jim Wu (Gnus GPG Mail) <email@gmx.com>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 1
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
> Someone creacked my key and passphrase
> 
Reason for revocation: Key has been compromised
Someone creacked my key and passphrase
Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Jim Wu (Gnus GPG Mail) <email@gmx.com>"
4096-bit RSA key, ID 12345678, created 2016-02-13

ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
```
Now the revocation certificate in ASCII armor - revoke.asc - has been created.

# Exporting keys

We have created a key pair and generate a revocation certificate for recovery. Now it's time to distribute the public key - exporting.

```bash
jim@laptop ~ $ gpg --export --armor email@gmx.com

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```
By default, the publick key will be exported on the STDOUT. But out goal is to distribute the public key over the Internet to our friends.

So usually add `--output name.pub` to export public key to *name.pub* file. It's recommended to distribute this file along with the *fingerprint* of the key.

Check `--fingerprint` argument of *gpg*.

# Importing keys

Once you get a copy of the exported public key of your friend, add it to your public keyring - importing.

Pay attention to verify its *fingerprint* in case you get a malicious public key.

1. gpg --import *friends.pub*
2. gpg --fingerprint
3. gpg --edit-key *friends-key*. `edit-key` prompts for sub-command to do key mangement tasks.
    1. fpr - print and compare the fingerprint of your friends public key.
    2. sign - make a signature of your friends public key by your own private key.
    3. check - check the result.

# Echange keys with servers

Both *export* and *import* are to distribute keys around friends you communicate with.

There are public key servers on the Internet where you can search/upload/download public keys - a public key pool.

Details refer to the reference.

# Agent

Like the SSH Agent, GPG agent cache the private key passphrase. A user don't need to input passphrase each time using the key.

Sometimes working with certain applications requires the use of a GPG key very frequently, which means that a passphrase must be frequently entered. In the past many applications supported a passphrase caching mechanism. This would make life easier for users because passphrases were automatically entered. However, this disallowed sharing this cache across programs (how secure would that be?) and forced applications to reinvent the wheel over and over again.

## pinentry

GnuPG includes *gpg-agent*. Pinentry (*app-crypt/pinentry*) is a helper application that *gpg-agent* uses to request the passphrase in a graphical window. It comes in three flavors: it can popup a window using the GTK+, QT, or curses libraries (depending on the USE flags set in */etc/portage/make.conf*). 

If *app-crypt/pinentry* was installed with more than one popup window type, it is possible to choose between the windows with the eselect pinentry command: 

```bash
laptop ~ # eselect pinentry list
Available pinentry binary implementations:
  [1]   pinentry-gtk-2 *
  [2]   pinentry-curses
laptop ~ # eselect pinentry set 1
```

## configuring gpg-agent

```bash
# ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
# called when prompt for passphrase the first time
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-gtk-2
# timeout 30 minutes
default-cache-ttl 1800
```

Now configure GnuPG to use an agent when appropriate. Edit *~/.gnupg/gpg.conf* and add the following line:

```bash
# ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
#
# DEPRECATED!
use-agent
```
Since GPG2, `use-agent` is deprecated as GPG2 always require *agent*.

## launch agent

An example of launching agent `gpg-agent --sh --daemon --enable-ssh-support --write-env-file /home/jim/.cache/gpg-agent-info`.

## automation

To launch GPG agent automatically on boot, add the command to startup scripts specially for servers (NO X/GUI). Details refer to reference.

On my Gentoo system, Xfce4 also starts the agent for you in /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc in a slightly different way to the above, as long as you don’t already have an agent running. This is perfectly adequate for us as well.

Check by `ps -ef | grep -i gpg-agent`.

## [optional] SSH mode

By default, the gpg-agent doesn’t enable its SSH agent. You have to explicitly enable it yourself, either by passing --enable-ssh-support on the command-line (which we could do by editing the Xsession script) or by `echo enable-ssh-support >> .gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`.

Next time we login and start the gpg-agent, it will enable its SSH mode for us. Great!

## GPG_AGENT_INFO

Like SSH agent, GPG agent exports an environmental variable `GPG_AGENT_INFO`.

## difference

SSH agent support `ssh-add` command to add private keys into agent in advance. GPG agent prompts for passphrase only when decryption.
