# Security

1. [WannaCry / Wcry / WannaCrypt](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/)

   [Turn off](https://superuser.com/q/1208963) SMB v1 and optionally v2 and/or v3 through *Turn Windows features on or off*. Then check by:

   >netstat -na | find "LISTENING" | find ":445 "

   Especially, Windows XP sp3 requires patch [Windows XP SP3 安全更新程序 (KB4012598)](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/confirmation.aspx?id=55245).
2. Anything related to Intel Management Engine (IME)  or Automatic Management Technology (AMT) should be avoid.

# Drivers

1. Unlike Widnows 8 onwards, Windows 7 ISO lack drivers (i.e. Ethernet, Wireless etc.). Upon installation, it probably cannot connect the Internet.

# Windows Embedded Standard 7

Installation tips:

- Use a Template - Thin Client.
- Modify Drivers & Modify Features.
- Automatically detect devices.
- Untick 'Resolve optional dependencies' otherwise final OS Footprint would be 3.4G around. Leave 'Resolve Dependencies' to the last step of package selection, which otherwise would pulls uncessary leftover.
- .Net Framework, tick everything. Miscellaneous applications depend on .NET framework.
- Application Support, untick 'MSMQ'.
- Boot Environments, 'Enhanced write filter boot Environment' to 'Windows Boot Environment'.
- Browsers, keep IE 8.
- Data Access and Storage, untick 'Windows Data Access Components - SQL'.
- Data Integrity, leave everything unticked.
- Devices and Printers, untick 'Printing Utilities and Management'.
- Diagnostics, leave 'Common Diagnostics Tools' and optionally 'User' ticked (Windows Task Manager).
- Embedded Enabling Features, untick everything and optionally tick 'Registry Filter' (for *regedit*).
- Fonts, tick 'Simplified Chinese Fonts'.
- Graphics and Multimedia, untick 'Windows Media Player 12'.
- International, leave everything unticked.
- Internet Information Service - IIS, leave everything unticked.
- Management, leave it alone.
- MediaCenter, leave everything unticked.
- Networking, untick everything and tick 'Network and Sharing Center', and optionally 'Wireless Networking'. With regards to 'Wireless Networking' part, VirtualBox does **not** support wirless adapters (only simulates Ethernet), which means you cannot add or see wirless adapter in Windows Device Manager. However, you can attach a USB Wi-Fi stick to guest OS and connect directly to Wi-Fi router.
- Remote Connections, untick 'Remote Desktop Connection'.
- Security, untick everything.
- System Services, leave it alone.
- User Interface, untick 'Help', 'Microsoft Speech API', and 'Accessibility'.
- Resolve Dependencies. Choose 'Unbranded Startup Screens', 'Windows Boot Environment', 'Standard Windows USB Stack' and 'Windows Explorer Shell' (a MSUT). Some previously unticked feature might be ticked again as a dependency of some other features.

## Key Management Server (KMS)

>KMS activation is not permanent.

A Microsoft Key Management Server (KMS) is a legitimate service offered under Microsoft Volume Activation 2.0 solution which is used to activate *volume* licensed Microsoft products. It works with minimal administration intervention and allows automated activation of Microsoft products (i.e. Windows OS, Office, Visio etc.).

With KMS activation method, the client (Microsft products) contacts verification server periodically to renew license. Each activation holds the license for 180 days. I will not go into details on KMS mechanism.

Here, I will set up a self-hosted KMS server :) based on FOSS reverse engineering code. Before that, please review a few notes on KMS:

1. KMS activates only Volume (VOL) licensing Microsoft products.

   'Windows Enterprise' is certainly VOL licensed while 'Windows Professionl' use either VOL license or retail license. Office versions downloaded from Microsoft MSDN and/or Technet are non-VOL. It's recommended to download VOL licensing editions from [itellyou.cn](https://msdn.itellyou.cn).

   >MAK activation method (one key forever) makes life easier on the premise that you succeed in finding a MAK key.

2. Where to put the KMS server side?

   Intuitively, we can deploy it on Windows system to be activated. However, local server may be compromised by Windows updates or anti-virus software. Beginning with Windows 8.1 the KMS server must be a different computer than the client. You cannot use *vlmcsd* on the same computer where you want to activate a product. If you have only one computer, you can run vlmcsd in a virtual machine. It's better to put the server side on a alway-on devices like VPS.

### [KMS emulator](https://www.efe.cc/?post=239)

Among the other things, [vlmcsd in C](https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd) and [py-kms in Python2](https://github.com/ThunderEX/py-kms/) are the most popular KMS emulators. They can run on almost any platforms like Windows, Cygwin, Linux, Android, OpenWrt, Unix, BSD etc. Here, I choose *vlmcsd* on CentOS 7 as an example.

>To set up KMS emulator on Windows system, you'd better use *py-kms*.

1. Firstly, build binaries from source.

   ```bash
   root@tux / # git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd.git
   root@tux / # cd vlmcsd
   root@tux / # man man/{vlmcsd.7,vlmcsd.8,vlmcs.1,vlmcsd.ini.5}
   root@tux / # make
   root@tux / # cp bin/vlmcs{d,} /usr/local/bin/
   root@tux / # vlmcsd -h
   root@tux / # vlmcs -h
   ```

   The author also provides routine binaries in the Github relase page.
2. Launch KMS server

   ```bash
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcsd -i- -L0.0.0.0:1688 -m1 -t3 -d -lsyslog -v -De" nobody
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcsd -i/etc/vlmcsd/vlmcsd.ini" nobody
   root@tux / # journalctl -t vlmcsd
   ```

   `-D` and `-e` are useful for terminal debugging.

   We can load arguments from a configuration file specified by `-i` command line option. With configuration file, we can send HUP signal to *vlmcsd* process without restarting.

   ```
   # /etc/vlmcsd/vlmcsd.ini

   Listen = 0.0.0.0:1688
   MaxWorkers = 1
   ConnectionTimeout = 3
   DisconnectClientsImmediately = TRUE
   LogFile = syslog
   LogVerbose = TRUE
   ```

   Command line options take precedence over the respective configuration line in the *.ini* file. For example, `-k` on command line overrides 'DisconnectClientsImmediately = TRUE'.
3. Firewalld

   Make sure the relevant port are accessible from outside.
4. Test KMS server

   ```bash
   # repeat these tests from another machines
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcs -v -e" nobody
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcs -v -x" nobody
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcs -v -l" nobody
   root@tux / # su -s /bin/bash -c "vlmcs 127.0.0.1:1688 -v -l23 " nobody
   root@tux / # journalctl -t vlmcsd
   ```

   1. *vlmcs* tests or charges KMS server. The KMS server can be the emulator set up above or a real official Microsoft KMS server.
   2. A Microsoft KMS server sends correct activation messages only if it detects a certain minimum of clients (25 for Windows client OSses, 5 otherwise) on the network. This is Microsoft's futile attempt to prevent running a KMS server in a home environment. Use the `-n` argument to charges a KMS server. Emulated KMS servers are always fully charged. As I set MaxWorkers to 1, `-n` > 1 will cause RPC error.
   3. The above *vlmcs* examples run in the same host as *vlmcsd*. Repeat those tests from another machines (i.e. where Microsoft products are to be activated).
5. Systemd unit (*/etc/systemd/system/vlmcsd.service*)

   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=KMS emulator
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   PermissionsStartOnly=true
   User=nobody
   Group=nobody
   LimitNOFILE=4096
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/vlmcsd -i/etc/vlmcsd/vlmcsd.ini

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   >There is no point in leaving this service always online as long as you remember to activate the product every 180 days.

### GVLK

KMS recognizes product type by General Volume License Key (GVLK). If you accidentally ignore GVLK during installation or entered the some other keys (i.e. invalid MAK key) afterwards, please restore [Windows GVLKs (a.k.a KMS Client Setup Key)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj612867.aspx), [Office GVLKs](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624355.aspx). Open an elevated command prompt on the client Windows:

For Windows:

```
slmgr
slmgr /ipk <GVLK>
```

For Office:

```
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16
cscript ospp.vbs
cscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:<GVLK>
```

Choose an approprate GVLK in accord with reference link above.

*slmgr* is for Windows OS and usually resides in the *system32* directory. *ospp.vbs* is for Office 2010/2013/2016. To use it, we should first change the current directory Office's installation. *slmgr.vbs* and *cscript ospp.vbs* without parameters print help message.

If you happened to install a retail licensing product (i.e. OEM, Home, and Ultimate Windows), then in all likelihood KMS is out of your luck. To check Windows version on command line:

```
wmic os get caption
```

There exist some inofficial GVLKs for retail licensing Windows, which can be found in *vlmcsd.8* man page. Hence, why not attempt to convert Windows to a KMS client as stated above? The only difference is that those inofficial GVLKs hold each activation for 45 or 30 days.

### Configure a client

For Windows OS, *skms* means *set KMS*:

```
slmgr.vbs /skms <kms-server[:tcp-port]>
```

For Office:

```
cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16
# -or-
cd C:/Program Files(x86)/Microsoft Office/Office16
#
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:<kms-server>
cscript ospp.vbs /setprt:<tcp-port>
```

### Activate a product

After telling a client the KMS address, Windows contacts it for activation on demands. To activate Windows system immediately, right click Computer, select Properties and activate there. Alternatively, do it on command line:

```
slmgr.vbs /ato
slmgr.vbs /xpr
slmgr.vbs /dlv
```

Similarly for Office:

```
cscript ospp.vbs /act
cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus
```
