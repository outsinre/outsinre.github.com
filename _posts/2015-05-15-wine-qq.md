title: Wine QQ
---

You cannot get rid of QQ even under Linux system. First install wine; then QQ. But a lot of extra configuration needs tunning.

1. _#_ echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
2. _#_ emerge -av app-emulation/wine

    > Wines needs abi\_x86_32 support. It will reminds you update package.use for wine.
    
    > This will take around nearly 6 hours, we'd better emerge it at night.
2. [Disabling the Menubuilder][1] or [Wine FAQ][2] **before running any command/app related to Wine**.

    ```bash
# File: ~/.bashrc
# Prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winemenubuilder.exe=d'
    ```
    By default, Wine will ruin your user file association. For example, on my Xfce4 and Thunar desktop, Wine sets `notepad` (installed along by default) as the default *plain text* file editor. What is more, Wine adds an right-click emnu *Open with Notepad*. Actually, the notepad of Wine looks ugly and does not support Chinese as well.

    So this step should be the **1st thing** after emerging to prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.

    The above method is for per-user configuration. We can actually apply this setting to system-wide (i.e. for root, for multiple accounts) like the 2nd step of [/usr/share/wine/wine.inf][3].

    If you have already installed Wine and run App without `Disabling the Menubuilder` bofore, refer to [How to prevent Wine from adding file associations?][6]
4. [Wine QQ @ allog.ml][4] or [Wine QQ @ phpcj.org][5]

    From above two links, get [wineQQ7.1.tar.xz](/assets/wineQQ7.1.tar.xz). We don't need the `ntdll.dll.so` to replace the original one since this bug is already fixed.

    >_$_ tar /path/to/wineQQ7.1.tar.xz -C ~/

    This command will extract three directories:
    
    ```
.wine
.local
.fonts
    ```
    The `.wine` directory is actually where Wines stores user configuration. But we create it before any Wine applications run. This extracted `.wine` is fine-tuned for the our QQ 7.1.
    
    Though `.local` fonts exists in current home directory, extract command wont delete any existing files. Instead, it only add the new files to there corresponding sub-directories. Don't worry!
    
    We don't need the `.fonts` directory since fonts on my system is already configured pretty good.

    >_$_ rm -rf ~/.fonts
5. Run QQ: *Applications Menu -> Internet -> Wine QQ*

    If this is the first time to run Wine related application, then Wine needs to update the local setting in `~/.wine` directory. Don't worry.

    The QQ we use is fine-tuned under KDE desktop not for Xfce4. But it runs smoothly except that the QQ表情 cannot be used.
