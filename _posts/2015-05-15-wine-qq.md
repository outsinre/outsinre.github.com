title: Wine (staging) QQ
---

You cannot get rid of QQ even under Linux system. First install wine; then QQ. But a lot of extra configuration needs tunning.

1. Install lastest Wine

    >_#_ echo "app-emulation/wine" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/wine

    Wine has many bugs and lacks features, and as such we'd better enable the `staging` USE flag. As [Gentoo Wiki][7] suggests, `staging` flag Installs the external patchset from [Wine-Staging][8]. Includes many bugfixes and features, including better performance in gaming.

    >_#_ echo "app-emulation/wine staging" >> /etc/portage/package.use/wine

    >_#_ emerge -av app-emulation/wine

    Actually from [Wine-Staging][8], we can install multiple Wine instances in parallel, for example from overlay [wine-overlay][9] which is binary package. So it won't take that long for emerge. For this case, I only choose the portage method instead. I don't want two Wine instances.

    > Wines needs abi\_x86_32 support. It will reminds you update package.use for wine.
    
    > This will take around nearly 6 hours since it needs nearly 85 dependencies, we'd better emerge it at night.
2. [Disabling the Menubuilder][1] or [Wine FAQ][2] **before running any command/app related to Wine**.

    ```bash
# File: ~/.bashrc
# Prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.
export WINEDLLOVERRIDES='winemenubuilder.exe=d'
    ```
    By default, Wine will ruin your user file association. For example, on my Xfce4 and Thunar desktop, Wine sets `notepad` (installed along by default) as the default *plain text* file editor. What is more, Wine adds an right-click emnu *Open with Notepad*. Actually, the notepad of Wine looks ugly and does not support Chinese as well.

    So this step should be the **1st thing** after emerging to prevent Wine from adding menu entries and desktop links.

    The above method is for per-user configuration. We can actually apply this setting to system-wide (i.e. for root, for multiple accounts) like the 2nd step of [/usr/share/wine/wine.inf][3].

    If you have already installed Wine and run App without `Disabling the Menubuilder` bofore, refer to [How to prevent Wine from adding file associations?][6]
4. [Wine QQ @ allog.ml][4] or [Wine QQ @ phpcj.org][5]

    From above two links, get [wineQQ7.1.tar.xz](/assets/wineQQ7.1.tar.xz) and [ntdll.dll.so](/assets/ntdll.dll.so).

    >_$_ tar /path/to/wineQQ7.1.tar.xz -C ~/

    This command will extract three directories:
    
    ```
.wine
.local
.fonts
    ```
    The `.wine` directory is actually where Wines stores user configuration. But we create it before any Wine applications run. This extracted `.wine` is fine-tuned for the our QQ 7.1.
    
    Though `.local` fonts exists in current home directory, extract command wont delete any existing files. Instead, it only add the new files to there corresponding sub-directories. Don't worry!
    
    We don't need the `.fonts` directory since fonts on my system is already configured pretty good.

    >_$_ rm -rf ~/.fonts

    Replace the original `ntdll.dll.so`: 这个只能阻止QQ崩溃的问题，但是依然无法查看群共享、消息记录等东西。

    >_#_ mv /usr/lib32/wine/ntdll.dll.so /usr/lib32/wine/ntdll.dll.so_backup; cp [ntdll.dll.so](/assets/ntdll.dll.so) /usr/lib32/wine/
5. Run QQ: *Applications Menu -> Internet -> Wine QQ*

    If this is the first time to run Wine related application, then Wine needs to update the local setting in `~/.wine` directory. Don't worry.

6. Issues:

    QQ表情无法使用；
    
    无法右键粘贴复制，但是可以Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V；

    修改在线状态比较困难，点击很多次根本没反应；

    点击消息记录、群共享等时崩溃，QQ退出。按照第四步的方法替换`ntdll.dll.so`后不崩溃，但是依然无法实现那些功能。

    > 这个问题解决了，就是安装Wine的时候加上staging USE flag。
