Robust File Copy for Windows command `robocopy` is a tool under Windows system to *mirror* or *incrementally backup* with versitle parameters.

The basic usage of `robocopy` is like:

```
robocopy <source-dir> <dest-dir> [file [file] ...] [options]
```

By default, file/directory to copy can be wildcards that default to `*.*` (omitted usually). The following is an example that mirror disk parittion D:

```
# /MIR = /E /PURGE
F:\>robocopy D:\ E:\backup /MIR /COPY:DATS /DCOPY:DAT [/MINAGE:1] [/MAXAGE:7] /MAXLAD:20200627 /XA:SH /XD "System Volume Information" "$RECYCLE.BIN" /R:3 /W:10 /UNILOG+:G:\robocopy.log
```

1. `/MIR` mirrors a directory tree, equivalent to `/E /PURGE`.
2. `/COPY:DATS` copies Data, Attributes, Timestamp and NTFS Security ACLs fo files.

   By default, Security info is not copied.
3. `/DCOPY:DAT` copies Data, Atrributes, Timestamp of directories.

   By default, Timestamp is not copied.
4. `/MINAGE:n` and `/MAXAGE:n` exclude files according to their ages.

   MINAGE guarantees that files being updated won't copied. On the contrary, MAXAGE skip files old enough.

   `n` can be the number of days or date in `YYYYMMDD` format. It should adapt to the bakcup *cron* job.
5. `/MINLAD:n` and `/MAXLAD:n` exclude files according to their Last Access Date.
6. `/XA:SH` excludes files with Hidden or System attributes.

   In return, we have `/IA:SH` to copy only files with specified attributes.
7. `/XD <dir>` excludes specific directories.

   In return, we have `/XF` to exclude specific files.
8. `/R:3` retries 3 times on failed copies. By default, it is 1 million.

   `/W:10` wait for 10 seconds between retries.
9. `/UNILOG+:G:\robocopy.log` redirects log to file with UNICODE encoding.
