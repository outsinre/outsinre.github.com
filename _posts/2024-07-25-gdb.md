title: GDB and gef

This is a GDB tutorial to dynamic analyze and exploit programs.

# Limitation #

1. GDB currently does not support Apple Arm (M1).

# Introduction #

gdb is a shell command capable of inspecting details of a process.

Launch a process.

```bash
~ $ gdb /path/to/program
```

Debug a core dump. With the option `-c`, you can omit the binary.

```bash
# binary available
~ $ gdb /path/to/program <core.xyz>

# no binary; must have '-c'
~ $ gdb -c core.xyz
```

Attach to an existing process. With the option `-p`, you can omit the binary.

```bash
# with binary
~ $ gdb /path/to/program <pid>

# no binary; must have '-p'
~ $ gdb -p <pid>
```

Once started, gbd presents you an interactive environment and waits for gdb commands.

# Extension gef #

[gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef) is a Python plugin for vanilla GDB, supporting both x86 (32/64) and Arm (AArch 32/64). It is as actively maintained as its successor [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg), comes with just a single Python script file and requires no dependencies except Python.

There are other alternatives like pwndbg and [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda). pwndbg is actively maintained as gef, but the installation script introduces customizations, and spreads files everywhere. The script might introduce conflicts things conflicting with my local setup (e.g. *bashrc*). I quite do not like this style. peda, on the other hand, is almost deprecated, and the last commit is from 4 years ago.

In this post, we elect gef!

Download gef.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-9-194:~/workspace/ git clone https://github.com/hugsy/gef

ubuntu@ip-172-31-9-194:~/workspace$ cd gef/
ubuntu@ip-172-31-9-194:~/workspace/gef$ ls
LICENSE  README.md  docs  gef.py  mkdocs.yml  scripts  tests
```

Enable gef plugin automatically.

```bash
~ $ echo 'source /path/to/gef.py' >> ~/.gdbinit
```

Alternatively, we can load gef on the fly.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-9-194:~/misc$ gdb
