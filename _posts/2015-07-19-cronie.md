title: Cronie and Anacron
---

*cron* automates taks sheduling at specific time. There are many different implementations of which I choose *cronie* with *anacron* USE flag enabled. It accomplishes this task by waking up *every minute* and checking to see if there are any cron-jobs to run in any of the user crontabs.

It is basically for servers that won't shutdown. Sheduled tasks would *not* be ran if the machine is powered off at the exact sheduled time. *anacron* however, does not assume the machine is running continuously. *anacron* usually relies on another *cron* daemon (i.e. *cronie*) and executes commands at intervals specified in day. It will run missed jobs upon startup.

```bash
root@tux ~ # echo 'sys-process/cronie anacron' > /etc/portage/package.use/cronie (opt)
root@tux ~ # emerge -avt virtual/cron
root@tux ~ # rc-update add cronie default
```

*cronie* has built-in *anacron* feature that is optionally now.

*cronie* schedules locates in */etc/crontab* and */etc/cron.d/*, while *anacron* in */etc/anacrontab*. Like most other *cron* daemons, *cronie* depends on *sys-process/cronbase* whose jobs in */etc/cron.{daily,hourly,weekly,monthly}*. So we have three *cron* components, namely *cronbase*, *cronie*, and *anacron* which can be combined to meet our job schedule requirements.

All those above are system-wide schedules and we can *manually* edit those files. We define user schedules with `crontab` command:

```bash
root@tux ~ # crontab [ -u USER ] [ -l | -e | -r ]
```

`crontab` command does not handle system-wide schedules. Without explicit `-u` argument, it defaults to *root* account. It edits (or creates) file */var/spool/cron/conrtabs/${USER}*. File name is the same as user account name. When executing commands under `su` you should always use the `-u` option.

The built-in *anacron* feature does not bring in command line to edit */etc/anacrontab*. Like system-wide schedules, *anacron* schedules should be updated manually.

Let's have a look at the default system-wide schedules. In */etc/crontab*, we found:

```
59  *  * * *    root    rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.hourly
9  3  * * *     root    rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.daily
19 4  * * 6     root    rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.weekly
29 5  1 * *     root    rm -f /var/spool/cron/lastrun/cron.monthly
*/10  *  * * *  root    test -x /usr/sbin/run-crons && /usr/sbin/run-crons
```

*cronie* daemon runs `run-crons` script (comes with *cronbase*) every 10 minutes. `run-crons` looks into */etc/cron.[hourly|daily|weekly|monthly]* for scripts to be executed. For example, */etc/cron.daily/logrotate*.

The schedules above gurantee jobs got ran even if the computer was off when they were scheduled to run. Details can be checken from *run-crons* script. Therefore, there is no need to enable `anacron` USE.

Specially, we found */etc/cron.hourly/0anacron* script. That is to say:

>*cronie* triggers *cronbase*'s hourly job *0anacron*.

At the tail of *0anacron*,  `anacron -s` handles schedules defined */etc/anacrontab*. Different from *cronie* that schedules jobs at fixed time , *anacron* schedules to run jobs every other days (day, week, month).

*/etc/cron.[daily|weekly|monthly]* will be ran twice by *cronie* (`run-crons`) and *anacron* (`run-parts`) at different times, leading to possible double job executions. 

Either remove `anacron` USE or comment out any overlapping entries from */etc/crontab* or */etc/anacrontab*.

Before a user can access to *crontab*, he must be in *cron* group by `gpasswd -a username cron`. Then we update */etc/cron.{allow, deny}:

```
# /etc/cron.deny
all

# /etc/cron.allow
username
```

With this setting, all users (except *root*) by default cannot access to *crontab*. We grant access by adding user name to *cron.allow*.
