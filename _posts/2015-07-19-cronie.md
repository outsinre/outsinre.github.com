6. Some special notes:

    `cron` is basically for servers that won't shutdown. Sheduled tasks of `cron` would **NOT** be executed if the machine is powered off at the sheduled time. A basic tool for `cron` is `crontab -e` command which edits (or creates one if not exist) file `/var/spool/cron/conrtabs/${USER}`. File name is the same as user account name. Please do **NOT** edit this file manually. Tasks sheduled there are user-specific tasks. For system tasks, edit file in `/etc/crontab` and `/etc/cron.d/` manully.

    `anacron` however, is used to execute commands periodically; does not assume that the machine is running continuously.  Hence, it can be used on machines that are not running 24 hours a day to control regular jobs as daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.
