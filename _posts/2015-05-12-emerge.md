1. _#_ emerge --resume

    > Think of a scenario when you have to reboot or shutdown while stilling emerging. You can just Ctrl+C to interrupt the emerging process. Later on when entering the system, run this command before any other emerge-related commands. This will save you a lot of time especially you have a long emerge list. For example, you are in the last one of 100 packages. This command will only continue to emerge the last package.
2. Verbose mode (-v)

    ```
       --verbose [ y | n ] (-v short option)
              Tell  emerge to run in verbose mode.  Currently this flag causes
              emerge to print out GNU info errors, if any, and to show the USE
              flags  that  will  be used for each package when pretending. The
              following symbols are affixed to USE flags in order to  indicate
              their status:


              Symbol   Location    Meaning
              ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

              -        prefix      not enabled (either disabled or removed)
              *        suffix      transition to or from the enabled state
              %        suffix      newly added or removed
              ()       circumfix   forced, masked, or removed
              {}       circumfix   state is bound to FEATURES settings
    ```
