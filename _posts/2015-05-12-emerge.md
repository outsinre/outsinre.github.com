1. _#_ emerge --resume

> Think of a scenario when you have to reboot or shutdown while stilling emerging. You can just Ctrl+C to interrupt the emerging process. Later on when entering the system, run this command before any other emerge-related commands. This will save you a lot of time especially you have a long emerge list. For example, you are in the last one of 100 packages. This command will only continue to emerge the last package.
