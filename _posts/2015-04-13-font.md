# ABC

1. Applications use fonts by *font systems*. There are two font systems, namely XLFD and XFT.
2. X Logical Font Description (XLFD) is an old font system, originally designed for *bitmap* fonts. Later on, XLFD adds in support for scalable fonts like PostScript Type1, TrueType (.ttf) and even newer OpenType (.otf). XLFD is almost depcreted but still required by ancient programs like *xterm*, *urxvt* and GTK+1.

   XLFD fonts is usually located under */usr/share/fonts* like 75dpi, 100dpi etc. An XLFD font name is a long string, as below:

   ```
   -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1
   ```

   The name contains fourteen hyphen-separated fields, with each field representing a property of the font. Not all fields are required to be present. In Emacs, we can use `C-x =` over a character so show the XLFD name.
   
   To set XLFD:
   
   1. For terminal, we use *xfontsel*, and *xlsfonts*.
   2. For X, we can use *xset*.
3. XFT is a newer font system, supporting much more font types. [depending](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/398739/74407) on Fontconfig's *matching* feature and Freetype's font *rendering* feature. Freetype makes fonts (e.g. anti‑aliasing and sub‑pixel rasterization) look smooth and beautiful.

   We configure Fontconfig to use XFT */etc/fonts/fonts.conf*.
3. Application decides to use which font system. Almost all applications use XFT now, Xorg included. Emacs supports both XLFD and XFT (try `M-x: describe-font`).

   However, we may tune FontPath in *xorg.conf* covering bitmap fonts for ancient programs. Most of the time, we do not include XFT fonts in *xorg.conf*. To check fonts knowns to X:

   ```
   $ grep /fonts /var/log/Xorg.0.log
   or
   $ xset q
   ```

# Fontconfig

Commands like *fc-list*, *fc-list*, *fc-query*, *fc-match* etc. can help check fonts' information.

## Per-user installation

```bash
~ $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/winfonts
~ $ cd ~/.local/share/fonts/winfonts
~ $ cp /path/to/{abc.ttf,123.otf} .

~ $ fc-cache -fv ./
~ $ mkfontscale ./ && mkfontdir ./ && xset fp rehash
```

1. For manually copied fonts, we have to create the font cache with *fc-cache*. Font cache is to speed up font loading. Package manager (i.e. *emerge*) takes care of it automatically.
2. *mkfontscale* and *mkfontdir* will create file *fonts.scale* and *fonts.dir* for XLFD fonts. *xset fp rehash* makes new fonts immediately available to current X sessions.

## System-wide installation

Install system-wide fonts are similar except that the fonts directories are different like */usr/share/fonts/* or */opt/fonts/*.

```bash
~ # mkdir /opt/fonts/winfonts
~ # chmod 755 /opt/fonts/winfonts
~ # cd /opt/fonts/winfonts
~ # cp /path/to/{abc.ttf,123.otf} ./
~ # chmod -R 644 .

~ # fc-cache -fv ./*
~ # mkfontscale ./ && mkfontdir ./
```

# Xorg FontPath

Most of time, Fontconfig works out of box without any further configuration. To support ancient applications that use XLFD, we might need to tune "FontPath".

For Xorg to load fonts directly (as opposed to the use of a font server - XFT), the directory for your newly added font must be added with a "FontPath" entry. This entry is located in the "Files" section of Xorg configuration file. An official example is */usr/share/doc/xorg-server-1.18.4/xorg.conf.example.bz2*.

Create */etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/15-font-path.conf*:

```
Section "Files"
# Multiple FontPath entries are allowed (which are concatenated together),
# as well as specifying multiple comma-separated entries in one FontPath
# command (or a combination of both methods).
# The default path is shown here.
#    FontPath	/usr/share/fonts/misc/,/usr/share/fonts/TTF/,/usr/share/fonts/OTF/,/usr/share/fonts/Type1/,/usr/share/fonts/100dpi/,/usr/share/fonts/75dpi/

    FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/misc"
    FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/100dpi,/usr/share/fonts/75dpi"
    FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/util"
    FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/encodings"
    ...
    FontPath "/usr/share/fonts/winfonts"
EndSection
```

1. "FontPath" entry can be a single font path or multiple comma-separated font paths (or a combination of both). Font paths must be quoted.
2. The default pathes (i.e. *100dpi*, *75dpi* etc.) are always scanned.
3. Pathes lack *fonts.scale* (*mkfontscale*) and *fonts.dir* (*mkfontdir*) are neglected.

>Under no circumstances, please install *font-adobe-100dpi* and font-adobe-75dpi*, which otherwise would incur TeXLive (i.e. *xdvi*) or Emacs bugs.

## Per-user configuration

Settings Font Path under */etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/* are system-wide effective. For per-user setting, add

```
xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/dejavu/           # Prepend a custom font path to Xorg's list of known font paths
```

to *~/.xinitrc*. To remove a Font Path, use *-fp* instead. Alternatively, execute it on command line.

## Rehash without logout

```bash
# xsetq fp rehash
```

# Sphere - infinality

*infinality* USE can be enabled globally in */etc/portage/make.conf*.

```bash
# echo "media-libs/freetype adobe-cff infinality" > /etc/portage/package.use/freetype
# emerge -av media-libs/freetype
# eselect fontconfig list
# eselect fontconfig enable 52-infinality.conf
```

*fontconfig-infinality* will draw in its own settings (*/etc/fonts/infinality*) which will interfere with the other fontconfig configuration. It's recommended to disable most of Fontconfig options while keeping *52-infinality.conf*. Specially, configurations related to specific fonts can be kept like *62-croscore-\**.conf* and *57-dejavu-\*.conf*.

You will find *fontconfig* (*/etc/fonts/*) and *infinality* (*/etc/fonts/infinality/*) has the nearly the same directory architecture. The *conf.d* sub-directory stores the selected symlinks, while *conf.avail* (or *conf.src*) stores all existing configurations. We use *eselect* which chooses and creates symbolic links under *conf.d* sub-directory.

Optionally, refer to reference number 3, set `embeddedbitmap` in `/etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf` to `true`.

## *infinality* symlinks

```bash
# eselect lcdfilter list
# eselect lcdfilter set 14, set to *windows-7*
# eselect infinality list
# eselect infinality set to *win7*
```

Make sure *lcdfilter* and *infinality* choose the same category.

# Practice

1. Use [Jin Buguo Linux字体美化实战(Fontconfig配置)](http://www.jinbuguo.com/gui/linux_fontconfig.html).
   1. All fonts in this practice are manually copied.
   2. Remove Korean fonts parts.
   3. Fonts under */opt/fonts/core* are fine-tuned.
   5. By default, */usr/share/fonts* is shared among XLFD, XFT and X11 Font Path. It's excluded from this schema.
2. */opt/fonts/ext* are complementary to */opt/fonts/core*.
   1. Put *wps-office* formula fonts under */opt/fonts/ext/wps-office*.
   2. Include */opt/fonts/ext* in *fonts.conf*.
3. Ancient applications using XLFD refer to X11 Font Path directly.
   1. Make sure *fonts.scale* (by *mkfontscale) and *fonts.dir* (by *mkfontdir*) exist under each directory of font directory.
   2. Paths under */opt/fonts/* can be appended to Font Path if you'd like.
