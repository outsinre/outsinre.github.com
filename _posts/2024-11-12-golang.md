The terminologies "Go" and "golang" might be used interchangeably throughout this post.

# Installation #

## macOS ##

We can [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) via `brew` or [officially built binary package](https://go.dev/dl/).

For the second method, just download and click the binary (e.g. `go1.23.3.darwin-arm64.tar.gz`). It will prompts us to install golang in the system directory `/usr/local/go`, for all users.

```bash
~ $ type go
go is hashed (/usr/local/go/bin/go)
```

To upgrade golang, just repeat the same process.

# GOPATH #

The environment variable [GOPATH](https://go.dev/wiki/GOPATH) is a pathname for installing extra modules beyond the official ones, usually residing in the user's home. It is also the place where we develop and test personal modules.

```bash
~ $ go env GOPATH
/Users/zachary/go
```
