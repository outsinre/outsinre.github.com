The terminologies "Go" and "golang" might be used interchangeably throughout this post.

# Installation #

## macOS ##

We can [install golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) via `brew` or [officially built binary package](https://go.dev/dl/).

To install or upgrade golang with `brew`.

```bash
~ $ brew install go|golang

~ $ type go
go is hashed (/opt/homebrew/bin/go)
~ $ go version
~ $ go env

~ $ brew upgrade go|golang
```

For the second method, just download and click the binary (e.g. `go1.23.3.darwin-arm64.tar.gz`). It will prompts us to install golang in the system directory `/usr/local/go`, for all users. For update, just repeat the same process.

```bash
~ $ type go
go is hashed (/usr/local/go/bin/go)
```

# GOPATH #

The variable [GOPATH](https://go.dev/wiki/GOPATH) is a pathname for installing extra modules beyond the official ones, usually residing in the user's home. It is also the place where we develop and test personal modules.

```bash
~ $ go env GOPATH
/Users/zachary/go

~ $ echo $GOPATH

~ $ ls go/bin/
go-wrk
```

Interestingly, it is not a Shell environment variable, but exclusive to golang! Upon installation, the golang toolchain would automatically configure it, including the `GOPATH/bin`. We can [manually configure it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21506074) for Shell reference.

```
# ~/.bash_profile

export GOPATH="${HOME}/go"
PATH="${GOPATH}/bin:$PATH"
```
